	abstract = {In computer vision and medical imaging, the problem of matching structures ﬁnds numerous applications from automatic annotation to data reconstruction. The data however, while corresponding to the same anatomy, are often very different in topology or shape and might only partially match each other. We introduce a new asymmetric data dissimilarity term for various geometric shapes like sets of curves or surfaces. This term is based on the Varifold shape representation and assesses the embedding of a shape into another one without relying on correspondences between points. It is designed as data attachment for the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework, allowing to compute meaningful deformation of one shape onto a subset of the other. Registrations are illustrated on sets of synthetic 3D curves, real vascular trees and livers’ surfaces from two different modalities: Computed Tomography (CT) and Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). All experiments show that this data dissimilarity term leads to coherent partial matching despite the topological differences.},

Our method is fully automatic and does not rely on user-provided landmarks or descriptors. This allows us to analyze the full space of maps and extract multiple diverse and accurate solutions, rather than optimizing for a single optimal correspondence as done in most previous approaches. To achieve this, we propose a compact tree structure based on the spectral map representation for encoding and enumerating possible rough initializations, and a novel efficient approach for refining them to dense pointwise maps. This leads to a new method capable of both producing multiple high-quality correspondences across shapes and revealing the symmetry structure of a shape without a priori information. In addition, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method is robust and results in more accurate correspondences than state-of-the-art for shape matching and symmetry detection.},

We consider two types of perturbations in our analysis: one is on the input shapes and the other is on the change in scale. In theory, we formulate and justify the robustness that has been observed in practical implementations of those frameworks. Inspired by our theoretical results, we propose a pipeline for constructing shape difference operators on point clouds and show numerically that the results are robust and informative. In particular, we show that both the shape difference operators and the derived areas of highest distortion are stable with respect to changes in shape representation and change of scale. Remarkably, this is in contrast with the well-known instability of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator computed on point clouds compared to those obtained on triangle meshes.},

Our method is based on the functional maps framework, but rather than promoting isometries we focus instead on near-conformal maps that preserve landmarks exactly.

Second, we establish the functional decomposition of conformal maps expressed in this basis. Finally, we formulate a conformally-invariant energy that promotes high-quality landmark-preserving maps, and show how it can be solved via a variant of the recently proposed ZoomOut method that we extend to our setting. Our method is descriptor-free, efficient and robust to significant mesh variability. We evaluate our approach on a range of benchmark datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on non-isometric benchmarks and near state-of-the-art performance on isometric ones.},

Structure typically appears in the form of individual parts and their arrangement. Knowing about object structure can be an important cue for object recognition and scene understanding - a key goal for various AR and robotics applications. However, commodity RGB-D sensors used in these scenarios only produce raw, unorganized point clouds, without structural information about the captured scene. Moreover, the generated data is commonly partial and susceptible to artifacts and noise, which makes inferring the structure of scanned objects challenging. In this paper, we organize large shape collections into parameterized shape templates to capture the underlying structure of the objects. The templates allow us to transfer the structural information onto new objects and incomplete scans. We employ a deep neural network that matches the partial scan with one of the shape templates, then match and fit it to complete and detailed models from the collection. This allows us to faithfully label its parts and to guide the reconstruction of the scanned object. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by comparing it to other state-of-the-art approaches.},

To this end, we present a non-rigid multi-part shape matching algorithm. We assume to be given a reference shape and its multiple parts undergoing a non-rigid deformation. Each of these query parts can be additionally contaminated by clutter, may overlap with other parts, and there might be missing parts or redundant ones. Our method simultaneously solves for the segmentation of the reference model, and for a dense correspondence to (subsets of) the parts.

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of information transfer across shapes and propose an extension to the widely used functional map representation. Our main observation is that in addition to the vector space structure of the functional spaces, which has been heavily exploited in the functional map framework, the functional algebra (i.e., the ability to take pointwise products of functions) can signiﬁcantly extend the power of this framework. Equipped with this observation, we show how to improve one of the key applications of functional maps, namely transferring real-valued functions without conversion to point-to-point correspondences. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that by decomposing a given function into a linear combination consisting not only of basis functions but also of their pointwise products, both the representation power and the quality of the function transfer can be improved signiﬁcantly. Our modiﬁcation, while computationally simple, allows us to achieve higher transfer accuracy while keeping the size of the basis and the functional map ﬁxed. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimally representing functions through linear combinations of products in a given basis and prove NP-completeness in some general cases. Finally, we argue that the use of function products can have a wide-reaching effect in extending the power of functional maps in a variety of applications, in particular by enabling the transfer of highfrequency functions without changing the representation size or complexity.},

	abstract = {Radiation therapy (RT) is an important component of breast cancer treatment that reduces local recurrence and improves survival after breast conservation. Breast conservation rates have increased significantly since the late 1980s and techniques have improved with greater awareness of the impact of radiation on the heart. An overview of randomized controlled trials of breast conservation using standard whole breast irradiation, whole breast hypofractionation, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and intraoperative radiation are reviewed. Selection criteria for breast conservation and the utility of adding a boost dose to the primary tumor site are reviewed. Modern dose constraints are documented and 10 different radiation techniques from the 1980s through to modern volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) are compared for a patient where the breast and internal mammary nodes are treated. A radiation boost reduces the risk of a recurrence for most, but not all patients. Short courses of RT over 3–4 weeks are generally as effective as longer courses. Short-term follow-up of trials of APBI show promise for selected good prognosis subgroups. The role of intraoperative radiation remains controversial. In the last 30 years, there have been significant advances in radiation techniques. Modern radiotherapy equipment and techniques will reduce complications and improve survival rates.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of non-rigid shape matching, and speciﬁcally the functional maps framework that was recently proposed to ﬁnd correspondences between shapes. A key step in this framework is to formulate descriptor preservation constraints that help to encode the information (e.g., geometric or appearance) that must be preserved by the unknown map. In this paper, we show that considering descriptors as linear operators acting on functions through multiplication, rather than as simple scalar-valued signals, allows to extract signiﬁcantly more information from a given descriptor and ultimately results in a more accurate functional map estimation. Namely, we show that descriptor preservation constraints can be formulated via commutativity with respect to the unknown map, which can be conveniently encoded by considering relations between matrices in the discrete setting. As a result, when the vector space spanned by the descriptors has a dimension smaller than that of the reduced basis, our optimization may still provide a fully-constrained system leading to accurate point-to-point correspondences, while previous methods might not. We demonstrate on a wide variety of experiments that our approach leads to signiﬁcant improvement for functional map estimation by helping to reduce the number of necessary descriptor constraints by an order of magnitude, even given an increase in the size of the reduced basis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the intra-fraction breast motion during long-lasting treatments of breast cancer with Helical Tomotherapy by means of an optical tracking system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of seven radio-transparent passive markers was placed on the thoraco-abdominal surface of twenty breast cancer patients and tracked by an infrared tracking system. A continuous non-invasive monitoring of intra-fraction motion from patient setup verification and correction to the end of radiation delivery was thus obtained. The measured displacements were analysed in terms of cyclic respiratory motion and slow baseline drift.
RESULTS: The average monitoring time per patient was 15.57min. The breathing amplitude of the chest was less than 2mm, on average, along all anatomical directions. The baseline drift of the body led to more significant setup uncertainties than the respiratory motion. The main intra-fraction baseline drifts were in posterior and inferior directions and occurred within the first eight minutes of monitoring. Considering the intra-fraction motion only, the resultant clinical-to-planning target volume safety margins are highly patient-specific and largely anisotropic.
CONCLUSION: The non-respiratory motion occurring during prolonged treatments induces notable uncertainties. Non-invasive continuous monitoring of patient setup variations including baseline drifts is recommended in order to minimize dosimetric deviations, which might jeopardize the therapeutic ratio between target coverage and the sparing of organs at risk.},

We demonstrate the utility of this representation in a range of shape analysis tasks, including improving functional maps in difﬁcult situations through the mediation of limit shapes, understanding and visualizing the variability within and across different shape classes, and several others. In this way, our analysis sheds light on the missing geometric structure in previously used latent functional spaces, demonstrates how these can be addressed and ﬁnally enables a compact and meaningful shape representation useful in a variety of practical applications.},

	abstract = {Spectral geometric methods have brought revolutionary changes to the field of geometry processing. Of particular interest is the study of the Laplacian spectrum as a compact, isometry and permutation-invariant representation of a shape. Some recent works show how the intrinsic geometry of a full shape can be recovered from its spectrum, but there are approaches that consider the more challenging problem of recovering the geometry from the spectral information of partial shapes. In this paper, we propose a possible way to fill this gap. We introduce a learning-based method to estimate the Laplacian spectrum of the union of partial non-rigid 3D shapes, without actually computing the 3D geometry of the union or any correspondence between those partial shapes. We do so by operating purely in the spectral domain and by defining the union operation between short sequences of eigenvalues. We show that the approximated union spectrum can be used as-is to reconstruct the complete geometry [MRC*19], perform region localization on a template [RTO*19] and retrieve shapes from a database, generalizing ShapeDNA [RWP06] to work with partialities. Working with eigenvalues allows us to deal with unknown correspondence, different sampling, and different discretizations (point clouds and meshes alike), making this operation especially robust and general. Our approach is data-driven and can generalize to isometric and non-isometric deformations of the surface, as long as these stay within the same semantic class (e.g., human bodies or horses), as well as to partiality artifacts not seen at training time.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a method to extract ‘Shape-DNA’, a numerical ﬁngerprint or signature, of any 2d or 3d manifold (surface or solid) by taking the eigenvalues (i.e. the spectrum) of its Laplace–Beltrami operator. Employing the Laplace–Beltrami spectra (not the spectra of the mesh Laplacian) as ﬁngerprints of surfaces and solids is a novel approach. Since the spectrum is an isometry invariant, it is independent of the object’s representation including parametrization and spatial position. Additionally, the eigenvalues can be normalized so that uniform scaling factors for the geometric objects can be obtained easily. Therefore, checking if two objects are isometric needs no prior alignment (registration/localization) of the objects but only a comparison of their spectra. In this paper, we describe the computation of the spectra and their comparison for objects represented by NURBS or other parametrized surfaces (possibly glued to each other), polygonal meshes as well as solid polyhedra. Exploiting the isometry invariance of the Laplace–Beltrami operator we succeed in computing eigenvalues for smoothly bounded objects without discretization errors caused by approximation of the boundary. Furthermore, we present two non-isometric but isospectral solids that cannot be distinguished by the spectra of their bodies and present evidence that the spectra of their boundary shells can tell them apart. Moreover, we show the rapid convergence of the heat trace series and demonstrate that it is computationally feasible to extract geometrical data such as the volume, the boundary length and even the Euler characteristic from the numerically calculated eigenvalues. This fact not only conﬁrms the accuracy of our computed eigenvalues, but also underlines the geometrical importance of the spectrum. With the help of this Shape-DNA, it is possible to support copyright protection, database retrieval and quality assessment of digital data representing surfaces and solids.},

	abstract = {We present a novel representation of maps between pairs of shapes that allows for efficient inference and manipulation. Key to our approach is a generalization of the notion of map that puts in correspondence real-valued functions rather than points on the shapes. By choosing a multi-scale basis for the function space on each shape, such as the eigenfunctions of its Laplace-Beltrami operator, we obtain a representation of a map that is very compact, yet fully suitable for global inference. Perhaps more remarkably, most natural constraints on a map, such as descriptor preservation, landmark correspondences, part preservation and operator commutativity become linear in this formulation. Moreover, the representation naturally supports certain algebraic operations such as map sum, difference and composition, and enables a number of applications, such as function or annotation transfer without establishing point-to-point correspondences. We exploit these properties to devise an efficient shape matching method, at the core of which is a single linear solve. The new method achieves state-of-the-art results on an isometric shape matching benchmark. We also show how this representation can be used to improve the quality of maps produced by existing shape matching methods, and illustrate its usefulness in segmentation transfer and joint analysis of shape collections.},

For both DIBH and free breathing (FB), treatment plans were created for 20 tangential and 20 locoregional left-sided breast cancer patients. During DIBH treatment, beam-on was triggered by a region of interest on the xiphoid process using a 3 mm gating window. Using a novel nonrigid algorithm, the Catalyst™ system allows for simultaneous real-time tracking of the isocenter position, which was used to calculate the intrafractional DIBH isocenter reproducibility. The 50\% and 90\% cumulative probabilities and maximum values of the intrafractional DIBH isocenter reproducibility were calculated and to obtain the dosimetric effect isocenter shifts corresponding to these values were performed in the treatment planning system. For both tangential and locoregional treatment, the dose to the heart, LAD and ipsilateral lung was significantly reduced for DIBH compared to FB. The intrafractional DIBH isocenter reproducibility was very good for the majority of the treatment sessions, with median values of approximately 1 mm in all three translational directions. However, for a few treatment sessions, intrafractional DIBH isocenter reproducibility of up to 5 mm was observed, which resulted in large dosimetric effects on the target volume and organs at risk. Hence, it is of importance to set tolerance levels on the intrafractional isocenter motion and not only perform DIBH based on the xiphoid process.},

In the 26 patients who had a ≥5 cm(3) and a ≥25\% decrease in lumpectomy cavity volume (LCV) between CT scans, the SFB plan using photons was different in terms of normal breast tissue volume irradiated (BTV) (p {\textless} 0.001), and field dimensions (p {\textless} 0.001). In 20/35 patients, the energy or field size changed for electron plans on CT2, but no tested characteristics predicted for a change. Less BTV was irradiated using electrons than photons in 29\% (CT1) to 37\% (CT2). SFB replanning needs to be individualized to each patient because of the variety of factors that can impact dosimetric planning. Replanning is recommended when using 3-field photons if the patient has experienced a ≥5 cm(3) and a ≥25\% decrease in LCV during WBI. Some patients may benefit from electron SFB replanning but no tested characteristics reliably predict those who may benefit the most. The amount of BTV irradiated is less with electrons than in photon plans and this has the potential to improve cosmesis, a clinically important outcome in breast-conserving therapy.},

	abstract = {Shape correspondence is an important and challenging problem in geometry processing. Generalized map representations, such as functional maps, have been recently suggested as an approach for handling difﬁcult mapping problems, such as partial matching and matching shapes with high genus, within a generic framework. While this idea was shown to be useful in various scenarios, such maps only provide low frequency information on the correspondence. In many applications, such as texture transfer and shape interpolation, a high quality pointwise map that can transport high frequency data between the shapes is required. We name this problem map deblurring and propose a robust method, based on a smoothness assumption, for its solution. Our approach is suitable for non-isometric shapes, is robust to mesh tessellation and accurately recovers vertex-to-point, or precise, maps. Using the same framework we can also handle map denoising, namely improvement of given pointwise maps from various sources. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art for both deblurring and denoising of maps on benchmarks of non-isometric shapes, and show an application to high quality intrinsic symmetry computation.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of localizing relevant subsets of non-rigid geometric shapes given only a partial 3D query as the input. Such problems arise in several challenging tasks in 3D vision and graphics, including partial shape similarity, retrieval, and non-rigid correspondence. We phrase the problem as one of alignment between short sequences of eigenvalues of basic differential operators, which are constructed upon a scalar function deﬁned on the 3D surfaces. Our method therefore seeks for a scalar function that entails this alignment. Differently from existing approaches, we do not require solving for a correspondence between the query and the target, therefore greatly simplifying the optimization process; our core technique is also descriptor-free, as it is driven by the geometry of the two objects as encoded in their operator spectra. We further show that our spectral alignment algorithm provides a remarkably simple alternative to the recent shape-from-spectrum reconstruction approaches. For both applications, we demonstrate improvement over the state-of-the-art either in terms of accuracy or computational cost.},

Beyond that, we show further that our formulation can be adapted to recover the underlying isometry among near-isometric shape collections with a theoretical guarantee, which is absent in the other spectral map synchronization frameworks. We demonstrate that our method improves the accuracy compared to the competing methods when synchronizing correspondences in both near-isometric and heterogeneous shape collections, but also signiﬁcantly outperforms the baselines in terms of map consistency.},

	abstract = {In digital world reconstruction, 2-dimensional surface of real objects are often obtained as polygonal meshes after an acquisition procedure using 3D sensors. However, such representation requires several manual efforts from highly experts to correct the irregularity of tessellation and make it suitable for professional applications, such as those in the gaming or movie industry. Moreover, for modelling and animation purposes it is often required that the same connectivity is shared among two or more different shapes. In this paper we propose a new method that exploits a remeshing-by-matching approach where the observed noisy shape inherits a regular tessellation from a target shape which already satisfies the professional constraints. A fully automatic pipeline is introduced based on a variation of the functional mapping framework. In particular, a new set of basis functions, namely the Coordinates Manifold Harmonics (CMH), is properly designed for this tessellation transfer task. In our experiments an exhaustive quantitative and quality evaluation is reported for human body shapes in T-pose where the effectiveness of the proposed functional remeshing is clearly shown in comparison with other methods.},

All patients underwent serial computed tomography (CT) imaging before and immediately after RT, as well as 2 months, 6 months, 2 years, and 3–4 years after RT. These CT scans were used to compare muscle volume changes. The pectoral muscle volume and muscle volume surrounding the scapular measurement was performed using 3D modelling after segmentation of the CT scans. In all patients, the pectoral muscle volume increased during the 2 months after RT, and there was continuous volume reduction from 2–48 months after RT. Changes in muscle volume ratio over time were analysed by repeated measure ANOVA and it was found that there was a significant change in the pectoral muscle volume (p {\textless} 0.001) from Just before RT and Immediately after RT at 2 month after RT.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: After breast-conserving surgery, a seroma often forms in the surgical cavity. If not drained, it may affect the volume of tumor bed requiring a boost after whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT). Our objective was to evaluate the change in seroma volume that occurs during WBRT, before boost planning.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed of women receiving breast-conserving therapy with evidence of seroma at the time of WBRT planning. Computed tomography (CT) simulation was performed before WBRT and before the tumor bed boost. All patients received either a hypofractionated (42.4 Gy/16 fraction + 9.6 Gy/4 fraction boost) or standard fractionated (50.4 Gy/28 fraction + 10 Gy/5 fraction boost) regimen. Seroma volumes were contoured and compared on CT at the time of WBRT simulation and tumor bed boost planning.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with evidence of seroma were identified and all patients received WBRT without drainage of the seroma. Mean seroma volume before WBRT and at boost planning were significantly different at 65.7 cm(3) (SD, 50.5 cm(3)) and 35.6 cm(3) (SD, 24.8 cm(3)), respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). Mean and median reduction in seroma volume during radiation were 39.6\% (SD, 23.8\%) and 46.2\% (range, 10.7-76.7\%), respectively. Fractionation schedule was not correlated with change in seroma volume. Length of time from surgery to start of radiation therapy showed an inverse correlation with change in seroma volume (Pearson correlation r = -0.53, p {\textless} 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The volume of seroma changes significantly during WBRT. Consequently, the accuracy of breast boost planning is likely affected, as is the volume of normal breast tissue irradiated. CT-based boost planning before boost irradiation is suggested to ensure appropriate coverage.},

	abstract = {Background \& purpose
With the introduction of more conformal techniques for breast cancer radiation therapy (RT), motion management is becoming increasingly important. We studied the breast-shape variability during RT after breast-conserving surgery (BCS).

Materials \& Methods
Planning computed tomography (CT) and follow-up cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans were available for 71 fractions of 17 patients undergoing RT after BCS. First, the CT and the CBCT scans were registered on bones. Subsequently, breast-contour data were generated. The CBCT contours were analyzed in 3D in terms of deviations (mean and standard deviation) relative to the contour of the CT scan for the upper medial, lower medial, upper lateral, and lower lateral breast quadrants, and the axilla.

Results
Regional systematic and random standard deviations of the breast quadrants varied between 1.5 and 2.1 mm and 1.0–1.6 mm, respectively, and were larger for the axilla (3.0 mm). An absolute average shape change of  ≥4.0 mm in at least one region was present in 21/71 fractions (30\%), predominantly in breast volumes {\textgreater} 800 cc (p = {\textless}0.01). Furthermore, seroma was associated with larger shape changes (p = 0.04).

Conclusions
Breast-shape variability varies between anatomic locations. Changes in the order of 4 mm are frequently observed during RT, especially for large breasts. This should be taken into account in the development of protocols for partial breast irradiation and boost treatment.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate and quantify the extent of breast deformation during the course of breast cancer (BC) radiotherapy (RT). The magnitude of breast deformation determines the additional outer margin needed for treatment planning to deliver a full dose to the target volume. This is especially important when using inverse planning techniques.
METHODS: A total of 93 BC patients treated with RT and with daily CBCT image guidance were selected for this study. Patients underwent either only breast-conserving surgery (BCS) (n = 5), BCS with sentinel node biopsy (n = 57) or BCS with radical axillary node dissection (n = 31). The treatment area included the whole breast and chest wall (54\%) or also the axillary lymph nodes (46\%). 3D-registration was conducted between 1731 CBCT images and the respective planning CT images to assess the difference in breast surface.
RESULTS: The largest maximum breast surface expansion (MBSE) was 15 mm; the average was 2.4 ± 2.1 mm. In 294 fractions (17\%), the MBSE was ≥5 mm. An outer margin of 8 mm would have been required to cover the whole breast in 95\% of the treated fractions. There was a statistically significant correlation between the MBSE and body mass index (r = 0.38, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes in the breast surface occur during the course of BC RT which should be considered in treatment planning. An additional margin outside the breast surface of at least 8 mm is required to take into account the anatomical changes occurring during BC RT.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify the variability of the breast surface position when aligning whole-breast patients to bony landmarks based on MV portal films or skin marks alone. Surface imaging was used to assess the breast surface position of 11 whole-breast radiotherapy patients, but was not used for patient positioning. On filmed fractions, AlignRT v5.0 was used to capture the patient's surface after initial positioning based on skin marks (28 “preshifts” surfaces), and after treatment couch shifts based on MV films (41 “postshifts” surfaces). Translations and rotations based on surface captures were recorded, as well as couch shifts based on MV films. For nonfilmed treatments, “daily” surface images were captured following positioning to skin marks alone. Group mean and systematic and random errors were calculated for all datasets. Pearson correlation coefficients, setup margins, and 95\% limits of agreement (LOA) were calculated for preshifts translations and MV film shifts. LOA between postshifts surfaces and the filmed treatment positions were also computed. All the surface captures collected were retrospectively compared to both a DICOM reference surface created from the planning CT and to an AlignRT reference surface. All statistical analyses were performed using the DICOM reference surface dataset. AlignRT reference surface data was only used to calculate the LOA with the DICOM reference data. This helped assess any outcome differences between both reference surfaces. Setup margins for preshifts surfaces and MV films range between 8.3–12.0 mm and 5.4–13.4 mm, respectively. The largest margin is along the left–right (LR) direction for preshift surfaces, and along craniocaudal (CC) for films. LOA ranges between the preshifts surfaces and MV film shifts are large (12.6–21.9 mm); these decrease for postshifts surfaces (9.8–18.4 mm), but still show significant disagreements between the two modalities due to their focus on different anatomical landmarks (patient's topography versus bony anatomy). Pearson's correlation coefficients further support this by showing low to moderate correlations in the anterior–posterior (AP) and LR directions (0.47–0.69) and no correlation along . The use of an AlignRT reference surface compared to the DICOM reference surface does not significantly affect the LOA. Alignment of breast patients based solely on bony alignment may lead to interfractional inconsistencies in the breast surface position. The use of surface imaging tools highlights these discrepancies, and allows the radiation oncology team to better assess the possible effects on treatment quality. PACS number: 87},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a method for analyzing and visualizing individual maps between shapes, or collections of such maps. Our method is based on isolating and highlighting areas where the maps induce signiﬁcant distortion of a given measure in a multi-scale way. Unlike the majority of prior work which focuses on discovering maps in the context of shape matching, our main focus is on evaluating, analyzing and visualizing a given map, and the distortion(s) it introduces, in an efﬁcient and intuitive way. We are motivated primarily by the fact that most existing metrics for map evaluation are quadratic and expensive to compute in practice, and that current map visualization techniques are suitable primarily for global map understanding, and typically do not highlight areas where the map fails to meet certain quality criteria in a multi-scale way. We propose to address these challenges in a uniﬁed way by considering the functional representation of a map, and performing spectral analysis on this representation. In particular, we propose a simple multi-scale method for map evaluation and visualization, which provides detailed multi-scale information about the distortion induced by a map, which can be used alongside existing global visualization techniques.},

The aim of this study was to estimate patient setup accuracy and margins obtained with two different SGRT workflows with and without daily kV- and/or MV-based image guidance (IGRT). Methods A total of 50 breast cancer patients were treated in DIBH, using SGRT for the patient setup, and IGRT for isocenter corrections. The patients were treated at two different departments, one using AlignRT® (25 patients) and the other using Catalyst™ (25 patients). Inter-fractional position errors were analyzed retrospectively in orthogonal and tangential setup images, and analyzed with and without IGRT. Results In the orthogonal kV-kV images, the systematic residual errors of the bony structures were ≤ 3 mm in both groups with SGRT-only. When fine-adjusted by daily IGRT, the errors decreased to ≤ 2 mm; except for the shoulder joint. The residual errors of the ribs in tangential images were between 1 and 2 mm with both workflows. The heart planning margins were between 3 and 7 mm. Conclusions The frequency of IGRT may be considerably reduced with a well-planned SGRT-workflow for whole-breast DIBH with residual errors ≤ 3 mm. This accuracy can be further improved with an IGRT scheme.},

Unlike a functional map, which represents a correspondence simply using the pull-back of function values, the adjoint operator reﬂects both the map and its distortion with respect to given inner products. We argue that this property of adjoint operators and especially their relation to the map inverse under the choice of different inner products, can be useful in applications including bi-directional shape matching, shape exploration, and pointwise map recovery among others. In particular, in this paper, we show that the adjoint operators can be used within the cycle-consistency framework to encode and reveal the presence or lack of consistency between distortions in a collection, in a way that is complementary to the previously used purely map-based consistency measures. We also show how the adjoint can be used for matching pairs of shapes, by accounting for maps in both directions, can help in recovering point-to-point maps from their functional counterparts, and describe how it can shed light on the role of functional basis selection.},

	abstract = {Shape is an important physical property of natural and manmade 3D objects that characterizes their external appearances. Understanding differences between shapes and modeling the variability within and across shape classes, hereinafter referred to as {\textbackslash}emph\{shape analysis\}, are fundamental problems to many applications, ranging from computer vision and computer graphics to biology and medicine. This chapter provides an overview of some of the recent techniques that studied the shape of 3D objects that undergo non-rigid deformations including bending and stretching. Recent surveys that covered some aspects such classification, retrieval, recognition, and rigid or nonrigid registration, focused on methods that use shape descriptors. Descriptors, however, provide abstract representations that do not enable the exploration of shape variability. In this chapter, we focus on recent techniques that treated the shape of 3D objects as points in some high dimensional space where paths describe deformations. Equipping the space with a suitable metric enables the quantification of the range of deformations of a given shape, which in turn enables (1) comparing and classifying 3D objects based on their shape, (2) computing smooth deformations, i.e. geodesics, between pairs of objects, and (3) modeling and exploring continuous shape variability in a collection of 3D models. This article surveys and classifies recent developments in this field, outlines fundamental issues, discusses their potential applications in computer vision and graphics, and highlights opportunities for future research. Our primary goal is to bridge the gap between various techniques that have been often independently proposed by different communities including mathematics and statistics, computer vision and graphics, and medical image analysis.},

The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Our signature, called the Heat Kernel Signature (or HKS), is obtained by restricting the well-known heat kernel to the temporal domain. Remarkably we show that under certain mild assumptions, HKS captures all of the information contained in the heat kernel, and characterizes the shape up to isometry. This means that the restriction to the temporal domain, on the one hand, makes HKS much more concise and easily commensurable, while on the other hand, it preserves all of the information about the intrinsic geometry of the shape. In addition, HKS inherits many useful properties from the heat kernel, which means, in particular, that it is stable under perturbations of the shape. Our signature also provides a natural and efficiently computable multi-scale way to capture information about neighborhoods of a given point, which can be extremely useful in many applications. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our signature, we present several methods for non-rigid multi-scale matching based on the HKS and use it to detect repeated structure within the same shape and across a collection of shapes.},

            The Average Mixing Kernel Signature is a novel spectral signature for points on non-rigid three-dimensional shapes. It is based on a quantum exploration process of the shape surface, where the average transition probabilities between the points of the shape are summarised in the finite-time average mixing kernel. A band-filtered spectral analysis of this kernel then yields the AMKS. Crucially, we show that opting for a finite time-evolution allows the signature to account for a mixing of the Laplacian eigenspaces, similar to what is observed in the presence of noise, explaining the increased noise robustness of this signature when compared to alternative signatures. We perform an extensive experimental analysis of the AMKS under a wide range of problem scenarios, evaluating the performance of our descriptor under different sources of noise (vertex jitter and topological), shape representations (mesh and point clouds), as well as when only a partial view of the shape is available. Our experiments show that the AMKS consistently outperforms two of the most widely used spectral signatures, the Heat Kernel Signature and the Wave Kernel Signature, and suggest that the AMKS should be the signature of choice for various compute vision problems, including as input of deep convolutional architectures for shape analysis.},

The transport plan is computed via two alternating convex optimizations, and is shown to minimize a generalized Dirichlet energy of both the map and its inverse. Computational efficiency is achieved through a coarse-to-fine approach in diffusion geometry, with Sinkhorn iterations modified to enforce bounded area distortion. The resulting inter-surface mapping algorithm applies to arbitrary shapes robustly, with little to no user interaction.},

Over the years, advances in diagnostic imaging have significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of radiotherapy. The introduction of AI has further optimized the segmentation of tumors and organs at risk, thereby saving considerable time for radiation oncologists. AI has also been utilized in treatment planning and optimization, reducing the planning time from several days to minutes or even seconds. Knowledge-based treatment planning and deep learning techniques have been employed to produce treatment plans comparable to those generated by humans. Additionally, AI has potential applications in quality control and assurance of treatment plans, optimization of image-guided RT and monitoring of mobile tumors during treatment. Prognostic evaluation and prediction using AI have been increasingly explored, with radiomics being a prominent area of research. The future of AI in radiation oncology offers the potential to establish treatment standardization by minimizing inter-observer differences in segmentation and improving dose adequacy evaluation. RT standardization through AI may have global implications, providing world-standard treatment even in resource-limited settings. However, there are challenges in accumulating big data, including patient background information and correlating treatment plans with disease outcomes. Although challenges remain, ongoing research and the integration of AI technology hold promise for further advancements in radiation oncology.},

	abstract = {Effective radiotherapy for cancer has relied on the promise of maximally eradicating tumor cells while minimally killing normal cells. Technological advancement has provided state-of-the-art instrumentation that enables delivery of radiotherapy with great precision to tumor lesions with substantial reduced injury to normal tissues. Moreover, better understanding of radiobiology, particularly the mechanisms of radiation sensitivity and resistance in tumor lesions and toxicity in normal tissues, has improved the treatment efficacy of radiotherapy. Previous mechanism-based studies have identified many cellular targets that can affect radiation sensitivity, notably reactive oxygen species, DNA-damaging response signals, and tumor microenvironments. Several radiation sensitizers and protectors have been developed and clinically evaluated; however, many of these results are inconclusive, indicating that improvement remains needed. In this era of personalized medicine in which patients’ genetic variations, transcriptome and proteomics, tumor metabolism and microenvironment, and tumor immunity are available. These new developments have provided opportunity for new target discovery. Several radiotherapy sensitivity-associated “gene signatures” have been reported although clinical validations are needed. Recently, several immune modifiers have been shown to associate with improved radiotherapy in preclinical models and in early clinical trials. Combination of radiotherapy and immunocheckpoint blockade has shown promising results especially in targeting metastatic tumors through abscopal response. In this article, we succinctly review recent advancements in the areas of mechanism-driven targets and exploitation of new targets from current radio-oncogenomic and radiation-immunotherapeutic approaches that bear clinical implications for improving the treatment efficacy of radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the use of this new technique, surface-guided radiotherapy (SGRT), for patient setup and motion management in various cancers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was collected from 533 patients, who received treatment in our hospital for various malignancies using SGRT from October 2019 to April 2021. We studied patient setup, interfraction position, and patient position during the breath-hold (BH) technique. The main advantage of SGRT is that, it is completely non-invasive and uses visible light to compare the patient's skin surface in the treatment room and planned treatment position. In this analysis, Monaco 5.51.10 (Elekta) treatment planning system, Versa HD Linear Accelerator, and AlignRT 6.2 (Vision RT) SGRT system were used.
RESULTS: With SGRT, treatment setup time can be reduced with more precision and techniques like Deep inspiration breathhold (DIBH) can be done with very good compliance.
CONCLUSION: SGRT has shown improved accuracy in patient setup compared to conventional laser setup. The daily kilo voltage imaging frequency can be reduced; it helps in reducing additional radiation exposure due to imaging. SGRT has demonstrated reproducibility with adequate accuracy in BH treatments in DIBH for breast and SBRT.},

	abstract = {The goal of the study was to evaluate the inter- and intrafractional patient setup accuracy of target volumes located in the head, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic regions when using SGRT, by comparing it with that of laser alignment using patient skin marks, and to calculate the corresponding setup margins. A total of 2303 radiotherapy fractions of 183 patients were analyzed. All patients received daily kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography scans (kV-CBCT) for online verification. From November 2019 until September 2020, patient setup was performed using laser alignment with patient skin marks, and since October 2020, using SGRT. The setup accuracy was measured by the six degrees of freedom (6DOF) corrections based on the kV-CBCT. The corresponding setup margins were calculated using the van Herk formula. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the impact of multiple factors on the setup accuracy. The inter-fractional patient setup accuracy was significantly better using SGRT compared to laser alignment with skin marks. The mean three-dimensional vector of the translational setup deviation of tumors located in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis using SGRT was 3.6 mm (95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.3 mm to 3.9 mm) and 4.5 mm using laser alignment with skin marks (95\% CI 3.9 mm to 5.2 mm; p = 0.001). Calculation of setup margins for the combined inter- and intra-fractional setup error revealed similar setup margins using SGRT and kV-CBCT once a week compared to laser alignment with skin marks and kV-CBCT every other day. Furthermore, comparable setup margins were found for open-face thermoplastic masks with AlignRT compared to closed-face thermoplastic masks with laser alignment and mask marks. SGRT opens the possibility to reduce the number of CBCTs while maintaining sufficient setup accuracy. The advantage is a reduction of imaging dose and overall treatment time. Open-face thermoplastic masks may be used instead of closed-face thermoplastic masks to increase the patient's comfort.},

Our networks can be discretized on various geometric representations such as triangle meshes or point clouds, and can even be trained on one representation then applied to another. We optimize the spatial support of diffusion as a continuous network parameter ranging from purely local to totally global, removing the burden of manually choosing neighborhood sizes. The only other ingredients in the method are a multi-layer perceptron applied independently at each point, and spatial gradient features to support directional filters. The resulting networks are simple, robust, and efficient. Here, we focus primarily on triangle mesh surfaces, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results for a variety of tasks including surface classification, segmentation, and non-rigid correspondence.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a framework designed to accurately predict piecewise linear mappings of arbitrary meshes via a neural network, enabling training and evaluating over heterogeneous collections of meshes that do not share a triangulation, as well as producing highly detail-preserving maps whose accuracy exceeds current state of the art. The framework is based on reducing the neural aspect to a prediction of a matrix for a single given point, conditioned on a global shape descriptor. The field of matrices is then projected onto the tangent bundle of the given mesh, and used as candidate jacobians for the predicted map. The map is computed by a standard Poisson solve, implemented as a differentiable layer with cached pre-factorization for efficient training. This construction is agnostic to the triangulation of the input, thereby enabling applications on datasets with varying triangulations. At the same time, by operating in the intrinsic gradient domain of each individual mesh, it allows the framework to predict highly-accurate mappings. We validate these properties by conducting experiments over a broad range of scenarios, from semantic ones such as morphing, registration, and deformation transfer, to optimization-based ones, such as emulating elastic deformations and contact correction, as well as being the first work, to our knowledge, to tackle the task of learning to compute UV parameterizations of arbitrary meshes. The results exhibit the high accuracy of the method as well as its versatility, as it is readily applied to the above scenarios without any changes to the framework.},

Thirdly, we use the trimmed method to gradually eliminate the effects of incorrect correspondences, which improves the robustness of the methods especially for the low overlap cases. Moreover, we also extend our method to the scale registration case. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is more reliable and robust in various situations, including missing points, noise and different scale factors.

Existing functional map learning methods all rely on the critical choice of the spectral resolution hyperparameter, which can severely affect the overall accuracy or lead to overfitting, if not chosen carefully. In this paper, we show that spectral resolution tuning can be alleviated by introducing spectral attention. Our framework is applicable in both supervised and unsupervised settings, and we show that it is possible to train the network so that it can adapt the spectral resolution, depending on the given shape input. More specifically, we propose to compute multi-resolution functional maps that characterize correspondence across a range of spectral resolutions, and introduce a spectral attention network that helps to combine this representation into a single coherent final correspondence. Our approach is not only accurate with near-isometric input, for which a high spectral resolution is typically preferred, but also robust and able to produce reasonable matching even in the presence of significant non-isometric distortion, which poses great challenges to existing methods. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach through experiments on a suite of challenging near-isometric and non-isometric shape matching benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a successful paradigm for non-rigid 3D shape correspondence tasks. An essential step in this pipeline consists in learning feature functions that are used as constraints to solve for a functional map inside the network. However, the precise nature of the information learned and stored in these functions is not yet well understood. Specifically, a major question is whether these features can be used for any other objective, apart from their purely algebraic role in solving for functional map matrices. In this paper, we show that under some mild conditions, the features learned within deep functional map approaches can be used as point-wise descriptors and thus are directly comparable across different shapes, even without the necessity of solving for a functional map at test time. Furthermore, informed by our analysis, we propose effective modifications to the standard deep functional map pipeline, which promote structural properties of learned features, significantly improving the matching results. Finally, we demonstrate that previously unsuccessful attempts at using extrinsic architectures for deep functional map feature extraction can be remedied via simple architectural changes, which encourage the theoretical properties suggested by our analysis. We thus bridge the gap between intrinsic and extrinsic surface-based learning, suggesting the necessary and sufficient conditions for successful shape matching.

	abstract = {3D shape matching is a long-standing problem in computer vision and computer graphics. While deep neural networks were shown to lead to state-of-the-art results in shape matching, existing learning-based approaches are limited in the context of multi-shape matching: (i) either they focus on matching pairs of shapes only and thus suffer from cycle-inconsistent multi-matchings, or (ii) they require an explicit template shape to address the matching of a collection of shapes. In this paper, we present a novel approach for deep multi-shape matching that ensures cycle-consistent multi-matchings while not depending on an explicit template shape. To this end, we utilise a shape-to-universe multi-matching representation that we combine with powerful functional map regularisation, so that our multi-shape matching neural network can be trained in a fully unsupervised manner. While the functional map regularisation is only considered during training time, functional maps are not computed for predicting correspondences, thereby allowing for fast inference. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging benchmark datasets, and, most remarkably, that our unsupervised method even outperforms recent supervised methods.},

Even though the ability to process non-rigid shapes is critical in various applications ranging from computer animation to 3D digitization, the literature still lacks a robust and flexible framework to match and align a collection of real, noisy scans observed under occlusions. Given a set of such point clouds, our method first computes the pairwise correspondences parameterized via functional maps. We simultaneously learn potentially non-orthogonal basis functions to effectively regularize the deformations, while handling the occlusions in an elegant way. To maximally benefit from the multi-way information provided by the inferred pairwise deformation fields, we synchronize the pairwise functional maps into a cycle-consistent whole thanks to our novel and principled optimization formulation. We demonstrate via extensive experiments that our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance in registration accuracy, while being flexible and efficient as we handle both non-rigid and multi-body cases in a unified framework and avoid the costly optimization over point-wise permutations by the use of basis function maps.},

	abstract = {We propose DeepMapping, a novel registration framework using deep neural networks (DNNs) as auxiliary functions to align multiple point clouds from scratch to a globally consistent frame. We use DNNs to model the highly non-convex mapping process that traditionally involves hand-crafted data association, sensor pose initialization, and global reﬁnement. Our key novelty is that “training” these DNNs with properly deﬁned unsupervised losses is equivalent to solving the underlying registration problem, but less sensitive to good initialization than ICP. Our framework contains two DNNs: a localization network that estimates the poses for input point clouds, and a map network that models the scene structure by estimating the occupancy status of global coordinates. This allows us to convert the registration problem to a binary occupancy classiﬁcation, which can be solved efﬁciently using gradientbased optimization. We further show that DeepMapping can be readily extended to address the problem of Lidar SLAM by imposing geometric constraints between consecutive point clouds. Experiments are conducted on both simulated and real datasets. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that DeepMapping often enables more robust and accurate global registration of multiple point clouds than existing techniques.

Furthermore, the new approach is shown to be more robust to incorrect correspondences, and thus makes it easier to tune the maximum match distance parameter present in most variants of ICP. In addition to the demonstrated performance improvement, the proposed model allows for more expressive probabilistic models to be incorporated into the ICP framework.

Fourteen of the most common outlier filters (such as M-estimators) have been tested in different types of environments, for a total of more than two million registrations. Furthermore, the influence of tuning parameters have been thoroughly explored. The experimental results show that most outlier filters have similar performance if they are correctly tuned. Nonetheless, filters such as Var. Trim., Cauchy, and Cauchy MAD are more stable against different environment types.

However, these methods couple the estimation of rotation and translation via a single regression branch, which suffers from the mutual interference among rotation and translation. In addition, previous methods extract and interact features in a single scale, which ignores the rich information from multiple scales. To address above issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-branch decoupled regression and multi-scale feature interaction (MDR-MFI) framework for point cloud registration. Firstly, we decouple the estimation of 7 transformation parameters via multiple regression branches. The decoupled structure effectively mitigates the mutual interference among 7 parameters, resulting in improved performance. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale feature extraction and interaction framework to encourage the network to learn more discriminative features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/hikvision-research/3DVision.},

	abstract = {The iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is widely used in three-dimensional (3D) point cloud registration, and it is very stable and robust. However, its biggest drawback is being easily trapped in a local optimal solution, which results in the incorrect registration result. Currently, there is neither a clear effective range to deﬁne whether the ICP algorithm will fall into a local optimum nor a study providing a comprehensive evaluation of the ICP algorithm. In this paper, we take the overlap ratio, angle, distance, and noise as the inﬂuencing factors of ICP and evaluate the validity, robustness, accuracy, and efﬁciency of point-to-point and point-to-plane ICP by using four datasets. We ﬁrst analyze the effective ranges of the two ICP algorithms with respect to overlap ratio, angle, and distance and then propose a universal effective range for the three factors. Next, the effect of Gaussian noise on the validity and accuracy of two ICPs is evaluated. We also analyze the factors inﬂuencing ICP accuracy and explain their changing rules. We ﬁnally study the effect of different parameters on the efﬁciency. All results are compared by using point-to-point and point-to-plane ICP algorithms. The results show that the overlap ratio has no effect on validity, but it has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on accuracy. The angle has a great impact on the validity and efﬁciency of ICP but has no effect on accuracy. The distance only affects validity, has a limited effect on efﬁciency and no effect on accuracy. Meanwhile, Gaussian noise has a little effect on the validity. In addition, the general effective range of point-to-point ICP is larger than that of point-to-plane ICP, but the point-to-plane ICP algorithm presents a better efﬁciency. The point-to-point ICP is more robust to Gaussian noise with respect to validity, while the point-to-plane is more resistant in terms of accuracy.},

We enumerate and classify many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence for nearly-ﬂat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants optimized for high speed. We demonstrate an implementation that is able to align two range images in a few tens of milliseconds, assuming a good initial guess. This capability has potential application to real-time 3D model acquisition and model-based tracking.},

	abstract = {Accurate registration is critical for robotic mapping and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Sparse or non-uniform point clouds can be very challenging to register, even in ideal environments. Previous research by Holz et al. has developed a mesh-based extension to the popular generalized iterative closest point (GICP) algorithm, which can accurately register sparse clouds where unmodified GICP would fail. This paper builds on that work by expanding the comparison between the two algorithms across multiple data sets at a greater range of distances. The results confirm that Mesh-GICP is more accurate, more precise, and faster. They also show that it can successfully register scans 4–17 times further apart than GICP. In two different experiments this paper uses Mesh-GICP to compare three different registration methods—pairwise, metascan, keyscan—in two different situations, one in a visual odometry (VO) style, and another in a mapping style. The results of these experiments show that the keyscan method is the most accurate of the three so long as there is sufficient overlap between the target and source clouds. Where there is unsufficient overlap, pairwise matching is more accurate.},

Establishing a meaningful correspondence between shapes is often difﬁcult since it generally requires an understanding of the structure of the shapes at both the local and global levels, and sometimes the functionality of the shape parts as well. Despite its inherent complexity, shape correspondence is a recurrent problem and an essential component of numerous geometry processing applications.

In the literature, embedding alignment has not been deﬁned formally, explored theoretically, or analyzed empirically. Here, we explore the embedding alignment and its parts, provide the ﬁrst formal deﬁnitions, propose novel metrics to measure alignment and stability, and show their suitability through synthetic experiments. Real-world experiments show that both static and dynamic RL methods are prone to produce misaligned embeddings and such misalignment worsens the performance of dynamic network inference tasks.

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of information transfer across shapes and propose an extension to the widely used functional map representation. Our main observation is that in addition to the vector space structure of the functional spaces, which has been heavily exploited in the functional map framework, the functional algebra (i.e., the ability to take pointwise products of functions) can signiﬁcantly extend the power of this framework. Equipped with this observation, we show how to improve one of the key applications of functional maps, namely transferring real-valued functions without conversion to point-to-point correspondences. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that by decomposing a given function into a linear combination consisting not only of basis functions but also of their pointwise products, both the representation power and the quality of the function transfer can be improved signiﬁcantly. Our modiﬁcation, while computationally simple, allows us to achieve higher transfer accuracy while keeping the size of the basis and the functional map ﬁxed. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimally representing functions through linear combinations of products in a given basis and prove NP-completeness in some general cases. Finally, we argue that the use of function products can have a wide-reaching effect in extending the power of functional maps in a variety of applications, in particular by enabling the transfer of highfrequency functions without changing the representation size or complexity.},

	abstract = {ÐWe propose a novel approach for solving the perceptual grouping problem in vision. Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging.},

However, in many cases, we are given not only two related shapes, but a collection of them, and considering each pairwise map independently does not take full advantage of all existing information. For example, a notorious problem with computing shape maps is the ambiguity introduced by the symmetry problem — for two similar shapes which have reﬂectional symmetry there exist two maps which are equally favorable, and no intrinsic mapping algorithm can distinguish between them based on these two shapes alone. Another prominent issue with shape mapping algorithms is their relative sensitivity to how “similar” two shapes are — good maps are much easier to obtain when shapes are very similar. Given the context of additional shape maps connecting our collection, we propose to add the constraint of global map consistency, requiring that any composition of maps between two shapes should be independent of the path chosen in the network. This requirement can help us choose among the equally good symmetric alternatives, or help us replace a “bad” pairwise map with the composition of a few “good” maps between shapes that in some sense interpolate the original ones. We show how, given a collection of pairwise shape maps, to deﬁne an optimization problem whose output is a set of alternative maps, compositions of those given, which are consistent, and individually at times much better than the original. Our method is general, and can work on any collection of shapes, as long as a seed set of good pairwise maps is provided.

The task of alignment in non-Euclidean domains is one of the most fundamental and crucial problems in computer vision. As 3D scanners can generate highly complex and dense models, the mission of ﬁnding dense mappings between those models is vital. The novelty of our solution is based on a cyclic mapping between metric spaces, where the distance between a pair of points should remain invariant after the full cycle. As the same learnable rules that generate the point-wise descriptors apply in both directions, the network learns invariant structures without any labels while coping with non-isometric deformations. We show here state-of-the-art-results by a large margin for a variety of tasks compared to known self-supervised and supervised methods.},

This allows us to obtain functional maps that promote orientation preservation, even when using descriptors, that are invariant to orientation changes. We then show how higher quality, approximately continuous and bijective pointwise correspondences can be obtained from initial functional maps by introducing a novel refinement technique that aims to simultaneously improve the maps both in the spectral and spatial domains. This leads to a general pipeline for computing correspondences between shapes that results in high-quality maps, while admitting an efficient optimization scheme. We show through extensive evaluation that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art results on challenging isometric and non-isometric correspondence benchmarks according to both measures of continuity and coverage as well as producing semantically meaningful correspondences as measured by the distance to ground truth maps.},

For the operation strategies of early staged (stage I and stage II) TNBC patients, BCS plus radiotherapy (BCS+RT), mastectomy only (MRM only) or MRM plus radiotherapy (MRM+RT) is feasible, but no clear conclusion has been made on the choice of these treatments. Methods: The early staged TNBC patients (stage I and stage II) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program database between 1973 and 2014 were included in the study. Survival curves, univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazards models and propensity score weighting were applied to evaluate the prognostic impact among BCS+RT, MRM only and MRM+RT for patients. Results: Both overall and cancer-specific survival analysis showed that BCS+RT had better prognostic effect than MRM and MRM+RT in the cohort of early-staged triple-negative breast cancer patients (overall survival, P {\textless} 0.001; cancer-specific survival, P {\textless} 0.001). By taking all the risk factors into a multivariate cox proportional model, MRM and MRM+RT remained to have detrimental effect on the prognosis compared with BCS+RT as shown by either overall (HR = 1.742, CI = 1.387-2.188, P {\textless} 0.001; HR = 1.449, CI = 1.038-2.204, P = 0.029) or cancer-specific survival (HR = 1.876, CI = 1.415-2.489, P {\textless} 0.001; HR = 1.701, CI = 1.168-2.478, P = 0.006). After we performed propensity score weighting and integrated the weights for each covariate in the multivariate cox proportional model. BCS+RT remained to be prognostic beneficial compared to the other treatment options (P {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion: BCS+RT demonstrated better prognosis than MRM only and MRM+RT treatments for early-staged TNBC patients.},

The TomoTherapy system, developed exclusively for IMRT, has two treatment modes: TomoDirect (TD) with a fixed gantry angle for beam delivery, and TomoHelical (TH) with rotational beam delivery. We compared the characteristics of TD with TH and 3D-CRT plans in the breast cancer patients. Ten consecutive women with left breast cancer received postoperative radiation therapy using TD including the chest wall/residual breast tissue and level II-III axial and supraclavicular lymph node area. Fifty percent of the planning target volume (PTV) was covered with at least 50 Gy in 25 fractions. TD, TH and 3D-CRT plans were created for each patient, with the same dosimetric constraints. TD and TH showed better dose distribution to the PTV than 3D-CRT. TD and 3D-CRT markedly suppressed low-dose spread to the lung compared with TH. Total lung V5 and V10 were significantly lower, while V20 was significantly higher in the TD and 3D-CRT plans. The mean total lung, heart and contralateral breast doses were significantly lower using TD compared with the other plans. Compared with 3D-CRT and TH, TD can provide better target dose distribution with optimal normal-organ sparing for postoperative radiation therapy including the chest wall/residual breast tissue and lymph node area in breast cancer patients. TD is thus a useful treatment modality in these patients.},

Furthermore, preoperative RT could serve as a tool for treatment stratification for de-escalation of treatments in the event of pathological complete response. The present literature review analyzed the available clinical data regarding the potential impact of preoperative RT. Overall, available clinical evidence of preoperative RT in BC remains limited, deriving mostly from retrospective case series.

A particularly useful case of such maps is isometries, which preserve geodesic distances between points on each shape. Although several algorithms have been proposed to ﬁnd approximately isometric maps between a pair of shapes, the structure of the space of isometries is not well understood. In this paper, we show that under mild genericity conditions, a single correspondence can be used to recover an isometry deﬁned on entire shapes, and thus the space of all isometries can be parameterized by one correspondence between a pair of points. Perhaps surprisingly, this result is general, and does not depend on the dimensionality or the genus, and is valid for compact manifolds in any dimension. Moreover, we show that both the initial correspondence and the isometry can be recovered efﬁciently in practice. This allows us to devise an algorithm to ﬁnd intrinsic symmetries of shapes, match shapes undergoing isometric deformations, as well as match partial and incomplete models efﬁciently.},

Registration is closely related to data fitting in which it comprises three core interwoven components: model selection, correspondences and constraints, and optimization. Study of these components 1) provides a basis for comparison of the novelties of different techniques, 2) reveals the similarity of rigid and nonrigid registration in terms of problem representations, and 3) shows how overfitting arises in nonrigid registration and the reasons for increasing interest in intrinsic techniques.

The problem is especially hard when the underlying shapes are non-rigid and are given up to a deformation. Partial matching is usually approached by computing local descriptors on a pair of shapes and then establishing a point-wise non-bijective correspondence between the two, taking into account possibly different parts. In this paper, we introduce an alternative correspondence-less approach to matching fragments to an entire shape undergoing a non-rigid deformation. We use region-wise local descriptors and optimize over the integration domains on which the integral descriptors of the two parts match. The problem is regularized using the Mumford-Shah functional.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to obtain consistent matches without requiring initial pairwise solutions to be given as input. We do so by optimizing a joint measure of metric distortion directly over the space of cycle-consistent maps; in order to allow for partially similar and extra-class shapes, we formulate the problem as a series of quadratic programs with sparsity-inducing constraints, making our technique a natural candidate for analysing collections with a large presence of outliers. The particular form of the problem allows us to leverage results and tools from the ﬁeld of evolutionary game theory.

The problem consists of matching similar parts of shapes that are dissimilar on the whole and can assume different forms by undergoing nonrigid deformations. Conceptually, two shapes can be considered partially matching if they have signiﬁcant similar parts, with the simplest deﬁnition of signiﬁcance being the size of the parts. Thus, partial matching can be deﬁned as a multcriterion optimization problem trying to simultaneously maximize the similarity and the size of these parts. In this paper, we propose a different deﬁnition of signiﬁcance, taking into account the regularity of parts besides their size. The regularity term proposed here is similar to the spirit of the Mumford-Shah functional. Numerical experiments show that the regularized partial matching produces semantically better results compared to the non-regularized one.},

To allow the images to share segmentation information with each other, we build a network that contains segmented as well as unsegmented images, and extract functional maps between connected image pairs based on image appearance features. These functional maps act as general property transporters between the images and, in particular, are used to transfer segmentations. We deﬁne and operate in a reduced functional space optimized so that the functional maps approximately satisfy cycle-consistency under composition in the network. A joint optimization framework is proposed to simultaneously generate all segmentation functions over the images so that they both align with local segmentation cues in each particular image, and agree with each other under network transportation. This formulation allows us to extract segmentations even with no training data, but can also exploit such data when available. The collective effect of the joint processing using functional maps leads to accurate information sharing among images and yields superior segmentation results, as shown on the iCoseg, MSRC, and PASCAL data sets.},

A key task in network construction is to make the maps consistent with each other. This consistency constraint, when properly defined, leads not only to a concise representation of such networks, but more importantly, it serves as a strong regularizer for correcting and improving noisy initial maps computed between pairs of shapes in isolation. Up-to-now, however, the consistency constraint has only been fully formulated for point-based maps or for shape collections that are fully similar.
            In this paper, we introduce a framework for computing consistent functional maps within heterogeneous shape collections. In such collections not all shapes share the same structure --- different types of shared structure may be present within different (but possibly overlapping) sub-collections. Unlike point-based maps, functional maps can encode similarities at multiple levels of detail (points or parts), and thus are particularly suitable for coping with such diversity within a shape collection. We show how to rigorously formulate the consistency constraint in the functional map setting. The formulation leads to a powerful tool for computing consistent functional maps, and also for discovering shared structures, such as meaningful shape parts. We also show how to adapt the procedure for handling very large-scale shape collections. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework significantly improves upon state-of-the-art data-driven techniques. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework in shape co-segmentation and various shape exploration tasks.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To determine whether the volume of a patient's breast is correlated with reliable daily setup in treatment of breast cancer with a helical tomotherapy treatment unit.
Methods and Materials
Thirty-six consecutive patients with breast cancer were treated on a helical tomotherapy unit. During simulation, kilovoltage CT images were obtained for treatment planning. These were fused with daily megavoltage CT scans, and after setup based on skin marks and laser alignment the necessary shifts were carried out. The magnitude of daily shifts (in millimeters) was retrospectively obtained from the daily image fusions, and the breast volume was obtained from the treatment plan. A total of 873 fusion scans were reviewed. Random error for absolute and directional daily shifts was evaluated for correlation to volume. Variation over time was also evaluated.
Results
Mean (SD) random shift for all patients in the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical directions was 2.7 (2.0), 3.1 (1.5), and 3.2 (2.6) mm, respectively. Mean (SD) absolute distance shifted was 6.0 (3.5) mm. There was no significant correlation between mean absolute or mean directional daily shift and breast volume (0.08, 0.08, 0.22, and 0.07, respectively). There was no correlation between setup variation and time.
Conclusions
In this cohort, there was no correlation between breast volume and degree of daily shift. There was no correlation between time course and setup variation. Therefore, setup variation does not improve or degrade with repeated treatment setups.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Nowadays, deep inspiratory breath-hold is a common technique to reduce heart dose in left-sided breast radiotherapy. This study evaluates the evolution of the breath-hold technique in our institute, from portal imaging during dose delivery to continuous monitoring with surface-guided radiotherapy (SGRT).
Materials and methods
Setup data and portal imaging results were analyzed for 98 patients treated before 2014, and SGRT data for 228 patients treated between 2018 and 2020. For the pre-SGRT group, systematic and random setup errors were calculated for different correction protocols. Residual errors and reproducibility of breath-holds were evaluated for both groups. The benefit of using SGRT for initial positioning was evaluated for another cohort of 47 patients.
Results
Online correction reduced the population mean error from 3.9 mm (no corrections) to 1.4 mm. Despite online setup correction, deviations greater than 3 mm were observed in about 10\% and 20\% of the treatment beams in ventral-dorsal and cranial-caudal directions, respectively. However, these percentages were much smaller than with offline protocols or no corrections. Mean absolute differences between breath-holds within a fraction were smaller in the SGRT-group (1.69 mm) than in the pre-SGRT-group (2.10 mm), and further improved with addition of visual feedback (1.30 mm). SGRT for positioning did not improve setup accuracy, but slightly reduced the time for imaging and setup correction, allowing completion within 3.5 min for 95\% of fractions.
Conclusion
For accurate radiotherapy breast treatments using deep inspiration breath-hold, daily imaging and correction is required. SGRT provides accurate information on patient positioning during treatment and improves patient compliance with visual feedback.},

We show how this approach can be used in conjunction with existing initialization techniques across a range of application scenarios, including symmetry detection, map refinement across complete shapes, non-rigid partial shape matching and function transfer. In each application we demonstrate an improvement with respect to both the quality of the results and the computational speed compared to the best competing methods, with up to two orders of magnitude speed-up in some applications. We also demonstrate that our method is both robust to noisy input and is scalable with respect to shape complexity.

Our approach takes its main inspiration from the well-established methodology of diffusion wavelets.

We demonstrate that it leads to a family of functions that inherit many attractive properties of the heat kernel (e.g., a local support, ability to recover isometries from a single point, efficient computation). Due to its natural ability to encode high-frequency details on a shape, the proposed method reconstructs and transfers \${\textbackslash}delta\$-functions more accurately than the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunction basis and other related bases. Finally, we apply our method to the challenging problems of partial and large-scale shape matching. An extensive comparison to the state-of-the-art shows that it is comparable in performance, while both simpler and much faster than competing approaches.},

	abstract = {Shape-matching is one central topic in Geometry Processing, with numerous important applications in Computer Graphics andshape analysis, such as shape registration, shape interpolation, modeling, information transfer and many others. A recent andsuccessful class of shape-matching methods is based on the functional maps framework [OBCS*12] where the correspondencesbetween the two surfaces is described in terms of a mapping between functions. Several effective approaches have been proposedto produce accurate and reliable functional maps, leading to need for a way to assess the quality of a given solution. Inparticular, standard quantitative evaluation methods focus mainly on the global matching error disregarding the annoyingeffects of wrong correspondences along the surface details. Therefore, in this context, it is very important to pair quantitativenumeric evaluations with a visual, qualitative assessment. Although this is usually not recognized as a problem, the latter taskis not trivial, and we argue that the commonly employed solutions suffer from important limitations. In this work, we offer a newvisual evaluation method which is based on the transfer of the object-space normals across the two spaces and then visualizethe resulting lighting. In spite of its simplicity, this method produces readable images that allow subtleties of the mapping to bediscerned, and improve direct comparability of alternative results.},

	abstract = {AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The TomoTherapy Hi-Art II system is able to deliver dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy within a helical geometry providing robust conformality and modulation, abrupt dose falloff, and reliable accuracy. A new upgrade named TomoDirect was introduced recently, allowing delivery of radiation at discrete angles with a fixed gantry. We present our preliminary clinical experience with TomoDirect.
METHODS: Three specific clinical contexts were chosen for the implementation of TomoDirect, namely palliation of bone metastasis pain (BP), whole brain radiation therapy for intracranial secondary lesions (WBRT), and adjuvant whole breast radiation therapy after conservative surgery for early stage breast cancer (AWBRT). After appropriate positioning, planning CT, contouring, and plan generation, all patients were treated with the TomoDirect upgrade of the TomoTherapy Hi-Art II system with different doses and fractionation according to clinical decision-making.
RESULTS: Between May and December 2010, 41 patients were treated with TomoDirect. Eighteen patients were treated for BP (mainly vertebral metastases) with a predominant posterior field arrangement. Seven patients were treated for WBRT (multiple brain lesions) with a parallel-opposed latero-lateral approach and 16 patients were treated for conventionally fractionated AWBRT mainly with a 2-field tangential approach. Radiation treatments were generally well tolerated and the acute toxicity was mild.
CONCLUSIONS: While helical tomotherapy allows the delivery of very sophisticated treatment plans, in certain anatomical sites and clinical contexts where the number of beam directions is constrained and supposed not to affect plan quality, TomoDirect might be an efficient means to deliver radiation at static angles with consistent dosimetric and clinical results.},

Our method is based on using the previously-proposed persistence diagrams associated with real-valued functions, and on the analysis of the derivatives of these diagrams with respect to changes in the function values. This analysis allows us to use continuous optimization techniques to modify a given function, while optimizing an energy based purely on the values in the persistence diagrams. We also present a procedure for aligning persistence diagrams of functions on different domains, without requiring a mapping between them. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these constructions in the context of the functional map framework, by ﬁrst giving a characterization of functional maps that are associated with continuous point-topoint correspondences, directly in the functional domain, and then by presenting an optimization scheme that helps to promote the continuity of functional maps, when expressed in the reduced basis, without imposing any restrictions on metric distortion. We demonstrate that our approach is efﬁcient and can lead to improvement in the accuracy of maps computed in practice.},

	abstract = {The question remains regarding the dosimetric impact of intrafraction motion in 3D breast treatment. This study was conducted to investigate this issue utilizing the 4DCT scan. The 4D and helical CT scan sets were acquired for 12 breast cancer patients. For each of these patients, based on the helical CT scan, a conventional 3D conformal plan was generated. The breast treatment was then simulated based on the 4DCT scan. In each phase of the 4DCT scan, dose distribution was generated with the same beam parameters as the conventional plan. A software package was developed to compute the cumulative dose distribution from all the phases. Since the intrafraction organ motion is reflected by the 4DCT images, the cumulative dose computed based on the 4DCT images should be closer to what the patient received during treatment. Various dosimetric parameters were obtained from the plan and 4D cumulative dose distribution for the target volume and heart, and were compared to deduce the motion-induced impacts. The studies were performed for both whole breast and partial breast treatment. In the whole breast treatment, the average intrafraction motion induced changes in , , , , and of the target volume were , , , , and , respectively, with the largest values at , , , , and , respectively. Motion had little impact on the of the target volume, but its impact on the of the target volume was significant. For left breast treatment, the motion-induced change to the heart could be negative or positive, with the largest increase at about . In partial breast treatment, the only non-insignificant impact was in the of the CTV (ranging from to 11.7\%). The results showed that the intrafraction motion may compromise target dose coverage in breast treatments and the degree of that compromise was correlated with motion magnitude. However, the dosimetric impact of the motion on the heart dose may be limited.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of orientation that naturally arises when representing shapes like curves or surfaces as currents. In the field of computational anatomy, the framework of currents has indeed proved very efficient to model a wide variety of shapes. However, in such approaches, orientation of shapes is a fundamental issue that can lead to several drawbacks in treating certain kind of datasets. More specifically, problems occur with structures like acute pikes because of canceling effects of currents or with data that consists in many disconnected pieces like fiber bundles for which currents require a consistent orientation of all pieces. As a promising alternative to currents, varifolds, introduced in the context of geometric measure theory by F. Almgren, allow the representation of any non-oriented manifold (more generally any non-oriented rectifiable set). In particular, we explain how varifolds can encode numerically non-oriented objects both from the discrete and continuous point of view. We show various ways to build a Hilbert space structure on the set of varifolds based on the theory of reproducing kernels. We show that, unlike the currents' setting, these metrics are consistent with shape volume (theorem 4.1) and we derive a formula for the variation of metric with respect to the shape (theorem 4.2). Finally, we propose a generalization to non-oriented shapes of registration algorithms in the context of Large Deformations Metric Mapping (LDDMM), which we detail with a few examples in the last part of the paper.},

Each of the fifteen studies we identified had more than ten live participants and assessed volume measurement accuracy using a gold-standard based on the volume, or mass, of a mastectomy specimen. Many of the studies from this review report large ({\textgreater} 200 ml) uncertainty in breast volume and many fail to assess measurement accuracy using appropriate statistical tools. Of the methods assessed, MRI scanning consistently demonstrated the highest accuracy with three studies reporting errors lower than 10\% for small (250 ml), medium (500 ml) and large (1,000 ml) breasts.

Unlike the commonly-used continuous optimization methods, our approach enforces the functional map to be associated with a pointwise correspondence as a hard constraint, which provides a stronger link between optimized properties of functional and point-topoint maps. Under this hard constraint, our solver obtains functional maps with lower energy values compared to the standard continuous strategies. Perhaps more importantly, the recovered pointwise maps from our discrete solver preserve the optimized for functional properties and are thus of higher overall quality. We demonstrate the advantages of our discrete solver on a range of energies and shape categories, compared to existing techniques for promoting pointwise maps within the functional map framework. Finally, with this solver in hand, we introduce a novel Effective Functional Map Reﬁnement (EFMR) method which achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on the SHREC’19 benchmark.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the study was to investigate if surface guided radiotherapy (SGRT) can decrease setup deviations for tangential and locoregional breast cancer patients compared to conventional laser-based setup (LBS). Materials and Methods Both tangential (63 patients) and locoregional (76 patients) breast cancer patients were enrolled in this study. For LBS, the patients were positioned by aligning skin markers to the room lasers. For the surface based setup (SBS), an optical surface scanning system was used for daily setup using both single and three camera systems. To compare the two setup methods, the patient position was evaluated using verification imaging (field images or orthogonal images). Results For both tangential and locoregional treatments, SBS decreased the setup deviation significantly compared to LBS (P {\textless} 0.01). For patients receiving tangential treatment, 95\% of the treatment sessions were within the clinical tolerance of ≤ 4 mm in any direction (lateral, longitudinal or vertical) using SBS, compared to 84\% for LBS. Corresponding values for patients receiving locoregional treatment were 70\% and 54\% for SBS and LBS, respectively. No significant difference was observed comparing the setup result using a single camera system or a three camera system. Conclusions Conventional laser-based setup can with advantage be replaced by surface based setup. Daily SGRT improves patient setup without additional imaging dose to breast cancer patients regardless if a single or three camera system was used.},

We propose an alternative recovery technique capable of guaranteeing a bijective correspondence and producing signiﬁcantly higher accuracy and smoothness.

We show that this approach has certain undesirable fundamental theoretical limitations, and can be undefined even for trivial maps in the smooth setting. Instead we propose a novel, theoretically well-justified approach for regularizing functional maps, by using the notion of the resolvent of the Laplacian operator. In addition, we provide a natural one-parameter family of regularizers, that can be easily tuned depending on the expected approximate isometry of the input shape pair. We show on a wide range of shape correspondence scenarios that our novel regularization leads to an improvement in the quality of the estimated functional, and ultimately pointwise correspondences before and after commonly-used refinement techniques.},

We ﬁrst observe that while contrastive learning can lead to powerful point-wise features, the learned correspondences commonly lack smoothness and consistency, owing to the purely combinatorial nature of the standard contrastive losses. To overcome this limitation we propose to boost contrastive feature learning with two types of smoothness regularization that inject geometric information into correspondence learning. With this novel combination in hand, the resulting features are both highly discriminative across individual points, and, at the same time, lead to robust and consistent correspondences, through simple proximity queries. Our framework is general and is applicable to local feature learning in both the 3D and 2D domains. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through extensive experiments on a wide range of challenging matching benchmarks, including 3D non-rigid shape correspondence and 2D image keypoint matching.},

            We introduce a novel learning-based method to recover shapes from their Laplacian spectra, based on establishing and exploring connections in a learned latent space. The core of our approach consists in a cycle-consistent module that maps between a learned latent space and sequences of eigenvalues. This module provides an efficient and effective link between the shape geometry, encoded in a latent vector, and its Laplacian spectrum. Our proposed data-driven approach replaces the need for ad-hoc regularizers required by prior methods, while providing more accurate results at a fraction of the computational cost. Moreover, these latent space connections enable novel applications for both analyzing and controlling the spectral properties of deformable shapes, especially in the context of a shape collection. Our learning model and the associated analysis apply without modifications across different dimensions (2D and 3D shapes alike), representations (meshes, contours and point clouds), nature of the latent space (generated by an auto-encoder or a parametric model), as well as across different shape classes, and admits arbitrary resolution of the input spectrum without affecting complexity. The increased flexibility allows us to address notoriously difficult tasks in 3D vision and geometry processing within a unified framework, including shape generation from spectrum, latent space exploration and analysis, mesh super-resolution, shape exploration, style transfer, spectrum estimation for point clouds, segmentation transfer and non-rigid shape matching.},

	abstract = {Rigid registration of two geometric data sets is essential in many applications, including robot navigation, surface reconstruction, and shape matching. Most commonly, variants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm are employed for this task. These methods alternate between closest point computations to establish correspondences between two data sets, and solving for the optimal transformation that brings these correspondences into alignment. A major difﬁculty for this approach is the sensitivity to outliers and missing data often observed in 3D scans. Most practical implementations of the ICP algorithm address this issue with a number of heuristics to prune or reweight correspondences. However, these heuristics can be unreliable and difﬁcult to tune, which often requires substantial manual assistance. We propose a new formulation of the ICP algorithm that avoids these difﬁculties by formulating the registration optimization using sparsity inducing norms. Our new algorithm retains the simple structure of the ICP algorithm, while achieving superior registration results when dealing with outliers and incomplete data. The complete source code of our implementation is provided at http://lgg.epfl.ch/sparseicp.},

Specifically, we first formulate the Dirichlet energy of the pulled-back shape coordinates, as a way to evaluate smoothness of a pointwise map across discrete surfaces. We then extend the recently proposed discrete solver and show how a strategy based on auxiliary variable reformulation allows us to optimize pointwise map smoothness alongside desirable functional map properties such as bijectivity. This leads to an efficient map refinement strategy that simultaneously improves functional and point-to-point correspondences, obtaining smooth maps even on non-isometric shape pairs. Moreover, we demonstrate that several previously proposed methods for computing smooth maps can be reformulated as variants of our approach, which allows us to compare different formulations in a consistent framework. Finally, we compare these methods both on existing benchmarks and on a new rich dataset that we introduce, which contains non-rigid, non-isometric shape pairs with inter-category and cross-category correspondences. Our work leads to a general framework for optimizing and analyzing map smoothness both conceptually and in challenging practical settings.},

	abstract = {In deformable registration, the geometric framework - large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping or LDDMM, in short - has inspired numerous techniques for comparing, deforming, averaging and analyzing shapes or images. Grounded in flows, which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid dynamics, LDDMM algorithms solve the flow equation in the space of plausible deformations, i.e. diffeomorphisms. In this work, we make use of deep residual neural networks to solve the non-stationary ODE (flow equation) based on a Euler's discretization scheme. The central idea is to represent time-dependent velocity fields as fully connected ReLU neural networks (building blocks) and derive optimal weights by minimizing a regularized loss function. Computing minimizing paths between deformations, thus between shapes, turns to find optimal network parameters by back-propagating over the intermediate building blocks. Geometrically, at each time step, ResNet-LDDMM searches for an optimal partition of the space into multiple polytopes, and then computes optimal velocity vectors as affine transformations on each of these polytopes. As a result, different parts of the shape, even if they are close (such as two fingers of a hand), can be made to belong to different polytopes, and therefore be moved in different directions without costing too much energy. Importantly, we show how diffeomorphic transformations, or more precisely bilipshitz transformations, are predicted by our algorithm. We illustrate these ideas on diverse registration problems of 3D shapes under complex topology-preserving transformations. We thus provide essential foundations for more advanced shape variability analysis under a novel joint geometric-neural networks Riemannian-like framework, i.e. ResNet-LDDMM.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to determine the changes in breast and excision cavity volumes after whole-breast irradiation and the adequacy of using the surgical scar to guide boost planning.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 30 women consecutively treated for 31 breast cancers were included in this study. Simulation CT scans were performed before and after whole-breast irradiation. CT breast volumes were delineated using clinically defined borders. Excision cavity volumes were contoured based on surgical clips, the presence of a hematoma, and/or other surgical changes. Hypothetical electron boost plans were generated using the surgical scar with a 3-cm margin and analyzed for coverage.
RESULTS: The mean CT breast volumes were 774 and 761 cc (p = 0.22), and the excision cavity volumes were 32.1 and 25.1 cc (p {\textless} 0.0001), before and after 40 Gy (39-42 Gy) of whole-breast irradiation, respectively. The volume reduction in the excision cavity was inversely correlated with time elapsed since surgery (R = 0.46, p {\textless} 0.01) and body weight (R = 0.50, p {\textless} 0.01). The scar-guided hypothetical plans failed to cover the excision cavity adequately in 62\% and 53.8\% of cases using the pretreatment and postradiation CTs, respectively. Per the hypothetical plans, the minimum dose to the excision cavity was significantly lower for tumors located in the inner vs. outer quadrants (p = 0.02) and for cavities {\textgreater}20 cc vs. {\textless}20 cc (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a significant reduction in the volume of the excision cavity during whole-breast irradiation. Scar-guided boost plans provide inadequate coverage of the excision cavity in the majority of cases.},

	abstract = {Respiratory motion during intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) causes two types of problems. First, the clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin needed to account for respiratory motion means that the lung and heart dose is higher than would occur in the absence of such motion. Second, because respiratory motion is not synchronized with multileaf collimator (MLC) motion, the delivered dose is not the same as the planned dose. The aims of this work were to evaluate these problems to determine (a) the effects of respiratory motion and setup error during breast IMRT treatment planning, (b) the effects of the interplay between respiratory motion and multileaf collimator (MLC) motion during breast IMRT delivery, and (c) the potential benefits of breast IMRT using breath-hold, respiratory gated, and 4D techniques. Seven early stage breast cancer patient data sets were planned for IMRT delivered with a dynamic MLC (DMLC). For each patient case, eight IMRT plans with varying respiratory motion magnitudes and setup errors (and hence CTV to PTV margins) were created. The effects of respiratory motion and setup error on the treatment plan were determined by comparing the eight dose distributions. For each fraction of these plans, the effect of the interplay between respiratory motion and MLC motion during IMRT delivery was simulated by superimposing the respiratory trace on the planned DMLC leaf motion, facilitating comparisons between the planned and expected dose distributions. When considering respiratory motion in the CTV-PTV expansion during breast IMRT planning, our results show that PTV dose heterogeneity increases with respiratory motion. Lung and heart doses also increase with respiratory motion. Due to the interplay between respiratory motion and MLC motion during IMRT delivery, the planned and expected dose distributions differ. This difference increases with respiratory motion. The expected dose varies from fraction to fraction. However, for the seven patients studied and respiratory trace used, for no breathing, shallow breathing, and normal breathing, there were no statistically significant differences between the planned and expected dose distributions. Thus, for breast IMRT, intrafraction motion degrades treatment plans predominantly by the necessary addition of a larger CTV to PTV margin than would be required in the absence of such motion. This motion can be limited by breath-hold, respiratory gated, or 4D techniques.},

	abstract = {Computational preoperative planning offers the opportunity to reduce surgery time and patient risk. However, on soft tissues such as the breast, deviations between the preoperative and intraoperative settings largely limit the applicability of preoperative planning. In this work, we propose a high-performance accurate simulation model of the breast, to fuse preoperative information with the intraoperative deformation setting. Our simulation method encompasses three major elements: high-quality finite-element modeling (FEM), efficient handling of anatomical couplings for high-performance computation, and personalized parameter estimation from surface scans. We show the applicability of our method on two problems: 1) transforming high-quality preoperative scans to the intraoperative setting for fusion of preoperative planning data, and 2) real-time tracking of breast tumors for navigation during intraoperative radiotherapy. We have validated our methodology on a test cohort of nine patients who underwent tumor resection surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy, and we have quantitatively compared simulation results to intraoperative scans. The accuracy of our simulation results suggest clinical viability of the proposed methodology.},

Methods and Materials Patients (n = 58) with a 27-to-31 split between right- and left-sided cancers were analyzed. Treatment beams were gated using AlignRT by registering the whole breast region-of-interest to the surface generated from the simulation CT scan. AlignRT recorded (three-dimensional) 3D displacements and the beam-on-state every 0.3 s. Means and standard deviations of the displacements during vDIBH for each fraction were used to calculate setup margins. Intra-DIBH stability and the intrafraction reproducibility were estimated from the medians of the 5th to 95th percentile range of the translations in each breath-hold and fraction, respectively. Results A total of 7269 breath-holds were detected over 1305 fractions in which a median dose of 200 cGy was delivered. Each fraction was monitored for 5.95 ± 2.44 min. Calculated setup margins were 4.8 mm (A/P), 4.9 mm (S/I), and 6.4 mm (L/R). The intra-DIBH stability and the intrafraction reproducibility were ≤0.7 mm and ≤2.2 mm, respectively. The isotropic margin according to SI (9.2 mm) was comparable to other institutions’ calculations that relied on x-ray imaging and/or spirometry for patients with left-sided cancer (9.8–11.0 mm). Likewise, intra-DIBH variability and intrafraction reproducibility of breast surface measured with SI agreed with spirometry-based positioning to within 1.2 and 0.36 mm, respectively. Conclusions We demonstrated that intra-DIBH variability, intrafraction reproducibility, and setup margins are similar to those reported by peer studies who utilized spirometry-based positioning.},

An overview of randomized controlled trials of breast conservation using standard whole breast irradiation, whole breast hypofractionation, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and intraoperative radiation are reviewed. Selection criteria for breast conservation and the utility of adding a boost dose to the primary tumor site are reviewed. Modern dose constraints are documented and 10 different radiation techniques from the 1980s through to modern volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) are compared for a patient where the breast and internal mammary nodes are treated. A radiation boost reduces the risk of a recurrence for most, but not all patients. Short courses of RT over 3–4 weeks are generally as effective as longer courses. Short-term follow-up of trials of APBI show promise for selected good prognosis subgroups. The role of intraoperative radiation remains controversial. In the last 30 years, there have been significant advances in radiation techniques. Modern radiotherapy equipment and techniques will reduce complications and improve survival rates.},

	abstract = {Purpose/Objectives
This treatment planning study compares whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) for different external beam techniques and geometries (free breathing (FB) and deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH)).

Material and Methods
Following approval by our institutional review board, a treatment planning study was performed for 10 patients with left-sided stage 0/I breast cancer enrolled in a Phase I–II study of APBI using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Following lumpectomy, patients received planning computerized tomography (CT) scans during FB and using an Active Breathing Control (ABC) device at DIBH. For the FB geometry, standard WBRT and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) APBI plans were created. For the DIBH geometry with ABC, WBRT, 3DCRT and IMRT APBI plans were created.

Results
All APBI techniques had excellent planning target volume (PTV) coverage. The maximum PTV dose was reduced from 116\% of the prescription dose to 108\% with the IMRT (DIBH) APBI plan. The maximum heart doses were {\textgreater}30 Gy for the WBRT techniques, 8.2 Gy for 3DCRT(FB), and {\textless}5.0 Gy for 3DCRT(DIBH) and IMRT(DIBH) techniques. The mean left anterior descending artery dose was significantly reduced from 11.4 Gy with WBRT(FB) to 4.2 for WBRT(DIBH) and {\textless}2.0 Gy with all APBI techniques.

Conclusions
While PTV coverage was acceptable with all techniques, the plans on the DIBH geometry resulted in a marked reduction in normal tissue dose compared with WBRT planned in the absence of cardiac blocking. Further study is needed to determine if these techniques result in clinical benefits.},

In the modern technological era, innovations and progress in breast RT and delivery techniques have greatly improved the clinical outcomes. Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is a modern RT technology that permits the modulation of RT beams, ensuring a more uniform dose distribution through the target tissue and better avoidance of underlying critical structures. Recently, several studies have been published on breast IMRT. However, the interpretation of these results can be challenging because of the wide diversity of patients and treatment. The purpose of this study was to review these studies, focusing on the impact of IMRT on reducing toxicity and increasing convenience, as well as addressing concerns regarding breast IMRT.},

We address these issues by designing neural networks capable of generating high-quality parametric 3D surfaces which are also consistent between views. Furthermore, the generated 3D surfaces preserve accurate image pixel to 3D surface point correspondences, allowing us to lift texture information to reconstruct shapes with rich geometry and appearance. Our method is supervised and trained on a public dataset of shapes from common object categories.

The elasticity functional to be minimized takes into account two different types of nonlinear energies: a membrane energy measuring the rate of tangential distortion when deforming the reference shell into the template shell, and a bending energy measuring the bending under the deformation in terms of the change of the shape operators from the undeformed into the deformed configuration. The variational method applies to surfaces described as level sets. It is mathematically well-posed and an existence proof of an optimal matching deformation is given. The variational model is implemented using a finite element discretization combined with a narrow band approach on an efficient hierarchical grid structure. For the optimization a regularized nonlinear conjugate gradient scheme and a cascadic multilevel strategy are used. The features of the proposed approach are studied for synthetic test cases and a collection of geometry processing examples.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces GenCorres, a novel unsupervised joint shape matching (JSM) approach. Our key idea is to learn a mesh generator to fit an unorganized deformable shape collection while constraining deformations between adjacent synthetic shapes to preserve geometric structures such as local rigidity and local conformality. GenCorres presents three appealing advantages over existing JSM techniques. First, GenCorres performs JSM among a synthetic shape collection whose size is much bigger than the input shapes and fully leverages the datadriven power of JSM. Second, GenCorres unifies consistent shape matching and pairwise matching (i.e., by enforcing deformation priors between adjacent synthetic shapes). Third, the generator provides a concise encoding of consistent shape correspondences. However, learning a mesh generator from an unorganized shape collection is challenging, requiring a good initialization. GenCorres addresses this issue by learning an implicit generator from the input shapes, which provides intermediate shapes between two arbitrary shapes. We introduce a novel approach for computing correspondences between adjacent implicit surfaces, which we use to regularize the implicit generator. Synthetic shapes of the implicit generator then guide initial fittings (i.e., via template-based deformation) for learning the mesh generator. Experimental results show that GenCorres considerably outperforms state-of-the-art JSM techniques. The synthetic shapes of GenCorres also achieve salient performance gains against state-of-the-art deformable shape generators.},

	abstract = {Various techniques have been developed and introduced to address the pressing need to create three-dimensional (3D) content for advanced applications such as virtual reality and augmented reality. However, the intricate nature of 3D shapes poses a greater challenge to their representation and generation than standard two-dimensional (2D) image data. Different types of representations have been proposed in the literature, including meshes, voxels and implicit functions. Implicit representations have attracted considerable interest from researchers due to the emergence of the radiance field representation, which allows the simultaneous reconstruction of both geometry and appearance. Subsequent work has successfully linked traditional signed distance fields to implicit representations, and more recently the triplane has offered the possibility of generating radiance fields using 2D content generators. Many articles have been published focusing on these particular areas of research. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of recent studies on implicit representation-based 3D shape generation, classifying these studies based on the representation and generation architecture employed. The attributes of each representation are examined in detail. Potential avenues for future research in this area are also suggested.},

	abstract = {Compositional 3D scene synthesis has diverse applications across a spectrum of industries such as robotics, films, and video games, as it closely mirrors the complexity of real-world multi-object environments. Early works typically employ shape retrieval based frameworks which naturally suffer from limited shape diversity. Recent progresses have been made in shape generation with powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, which increases the shape fidelity. However, these approaches separately treat 3D shape generation and layout generation. The synthesized scenes are usually hampered by layout collision, which implies that the scene-level fidelity is still underexplored. In this paper, we aim at generating realistic and reasonable 3D scenes from scene graph. To enrich the representation capability of the given scene graph inputs, large language model is utilized to explicitly aggregate the global graph features with local relationship features. With a unified graph convolution network (GCN), graph features are extracted from scene graphs updated via joint layoutshape distribution. During scene generation, an IoU-based regularization loss is introduced to constrain the predicted 3D layouts. Benchmarked on the SG-FRONT dataset, our method achieves better 3D scene synthesis, especially in terms of scene-level fidelity. The source code will be released after publication.},

Tailoring radiotherapy techniques and treatment positions can reduce radiation doses to normal organs and mitigate treatment-related toxicity. This study entailed a dosimetric comparison of six different external beam whole-breast irradiation techniques in both supine and prone positions. We selected fourteen breast cancer patients, generating six treatment plans in both positions per patient. We assessed target coverage and organs at risk (OAR) doses to evaluate the impact of treatment techniques and positions. Excess absolute risk was calculated to estimate potential secondary cancer risk in the contralateral breast, ipsilateral lung, and contralateral lung. Additionally, we analyzed the distance between the target volume and OARs (heart and ipsilateral lung) while considering the treatment position. The results indicate that prone positioning lowers lung exposure in X-ray radiotherapy. However, particle beam therapies (PBTs) significantly reduce the dose to the heart and ipsilateral lung regardless of the patient’s position. Notably, negligible differences were observed between arc-delivery and static-delivery PBTs in terms of target conformity and OAR sparing. This study provides critical dosimetric evidence to facilitate informed decision-making regarding treatment techniques and positions.},

	abstract = {Radiotherapy (RT) is delivered for purposes of local control, but can also exert systemic effect on remote and non-irradiated tumor deposits, which is called abscopal effect. The view of RT as a simple local treatment has dramatically changed in recent years, and it is now widely accepted that RT can provoke a systemic immune response which gives a strong rationale for the combination of RT and immunotherapy (iRT). Nevertheless, several points remain to be addressed such as the interaction of RT and immune system, the identification of the best schedules for combination with immunotherapy (IO), the expansion of abscopal effect and the mechanism to amplify iRT. To answer these crucial questions, we roundly summarize underlying rationale showing the whole immune landscape in RT and clinical trials to attempt to identify the best schedules of iRT. In consideration of the rarity of abscopal effect, we propose that the occurrence of abscopal effect induced by radiation can be promoted to 100\% in view of molecular and genetic level. Furthermore, the “radscopal effect” which refers to using low-dose radiation to reprogram the tumor microenvironment may amplify the occurrence of abscopal effect and overcome the resistance of iRT. Taken together, RT could be regarded as a trigger of systemic antitumor immune response, and with the help of IO can be used as a radical and systemic treatment and be added into current standard regimen of patients with metastatic cancer.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this guideline is to offer recommendations on fractionation for whole breast irradiation (WBI) with or without a tumor bed boost and guidance on treatment planning and delivery.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) convened a task force to address 5 key questions focused on dose-fractionation for WBI, indications and dose-fractionation for tumor bed boost, and treatment planning techniques for WBI and tumor bed boost. Guideline recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a predefined consensus-building methodology supported by ASTRO-approved tools for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength.
RESULTS: For women with invasive breast cancer receiving WBI with or without inclusion of the low axilla, the preferred dose-fractionation scheme is hypofractionated WBI to a dose of 4000 cGy in 15 fractions or 4250 cGy in 16 fractions. The guideline discusses factors that might or should affect fractionation decisions. Use of boost should be based on shared decision-making that considers patient, tumor, and treatment factors, and the task force delineates specific subgroups in which it recommends or suggests use or omission of boost, along with dose recommendations. When planning, the volume of breast tissue receiving {\textgreater}105\% of the prescription dose should be minimized and the tumor bed contoured with a goal of coverage with at least 95\% of the prescription dose. Dose to the heart, contralateral breast, lung, and other normal tissues should be minimized.
CONCLUSIONS: WBI represents a significant portion of radiation oncology practice, and these recommendations are intended to offer the groundwork for defining evidence-based practice for this common and important modality. This guideline also seeks to promote appropriately individualized, shared decision-making regarding WBI between physicians and patients.},

This paper presents an algorithm for automatically detecting the condition of cows in a real farm environment based on skeleton spatio-temporal features. The cow skeleton is obtained by matching Partial Confidence Maps (PCMs) and Partial Affinity Fields (PAFs). The effectiveness of skeleton extraction was validated by testing 780 images for three different poses (standing, walking, and lying). The results indicate that the Average Precision of Keypoints (APK) for the pelvis is highest in the standing and lying poses, achieving 89.52\% and 90.13\%, respectively. For walking, the highest APK for the legs was 88.52\%, while the back APK was the lowest across all poses. To estimate the pose, a Multi-Scale Temporal Convolutional Network (MS-TCN) was constructed, and comparative experiments were conducted to compare different attention mechanisms and activation functions. Among the tested models, the CMS-TCN with Coord Attention and Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation functions achieved precision, recall, and F1 scores of 94.71\%, 86.99\%, and 90.69\%, respectively. This method demonstrates a relatively high detection rate, making it a valuable reference for animal pose estimation in precision livestock farming.},

	abstract = {Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses. We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better constrained and more realistic model of human articulation.

Accomplishing these statistical applications is best if one recognizes that s-reps live on a curved shape space. Here we will lay out the definition of s-reps, their advantages and limitations, their mathematical properties, methods for fitting s-reps to single- and multi-object boundaries, methods for measuring the statistics of these object and multi-object representations, and examples of such applications involving statistics.

While intrinsic methods based on functional maps can produce high-quality correspondences, they work under isometric assumptions and become unreliable for garment deformations which are highly non-isometric. To achieve wrinkle-level as well as texture-level alignment, we present a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage method that leverages intrinsic manifold properties with two neural deformation fields, in the 3D space and the intrinsic space, respectively. The coarse stage performs a 3D fitting, where we leverage intrinsic manifold properties to define a manifold deformation field. The coarse fitting then induces a functional map that produces an alignment of intrinsic embeddings. We further refine the intrinsic alignment with a second neural deformation field for higher accuracy. We evaluate our method with our captured garment dataset, GarmCap. The method achieves accurate wrinkle-level and texture-level alignment and works for difficult garment types such as long coats.

However, despite the impact of this framework, the problem of recovering the point-to-point correspondence from a given functional map has received surprisingly little interest. In this paper, we analyse the aforementioned problem and propose a novel method for reconstructing pointwise correspondences from a given functional map. The proposed algorithm phrases the matching problem as a regularized alignment problem of the spectral embeddings of the two shapes. Opposed to established methods, our approach does not require the input shapes to be nearly-isometric, and easily extends to recovering the point-to-point correspondence in part-to-whole shape matching problems. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to a significant improvement in accuracy in several challenging cases.},

When the shapes are quite different, a point-to-point map is not always appropriate, so our focus in this paper is a method to build a set of correspondences between shape regions or parts. The proposed approach exploits a variety of feature functions on the shapes and makes use of the key observation that points in matching parts have similar ranks in the sorting of the corresponding feature values. Our algorithm proceeds in two steps. We ﬁrst build an afﬁnity matrix between points on the two shapes, based on feature rank similarity over many feature functions. We then deﬁne a notion of stability of a pair of regions, with respect to this afﬁnity matrix, obtained as a ﬁxed point of a nonlinear operator. Our method yields a family of corresponding maximally stable regions between the two shapes that can be used to deﬁne shape parts. We observe that this is an instance of the biclustering problem and that it is related to solving a constrained maximal eigenvalue problem. We provide an algorithm to solve this problem that mimics the power method. We show the robustness of its output to noisy input features as well its convergence properties. The obtained part correspondences are shown to be almost perfect matches in the isometric case, and also semantically appropriate even in non-isometric cases. We provide numerous examples and applications of this technique, for example to sharpening correspondences in traditional shape matching algorithms.},

The method is based on the analysis of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the Laplace-Beltrami operator computed on the triangulations: it generalizes previous works based on the analysis of diffusive processes and proves capable of providing more detailed information on the geometric properties of the triangulations. In particular, we apply the method to the analysis of spatial slices, showing that the different phases can be characterized by a new order parameter related to the presence or absence of a gap in the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and deriving an effective dimensionality of the slices at the different scales. We also propose quantities derived from the spectrum that could be used to monitor the running to the continuum limit around a suitable critical point in the phase diagram, if any is found.},

Although the beneﬁts of anisotropic diﬀusion have already been noted in the area of mesh processing (e.g. surface regularization), focusing on the Laplacian itself, rather than on the diffusion process it induces, opens the possibility to eﬀectively replace the omnipresent Laplace-Beltrami operator in many shape analysis methods.

For example, many data-driven approaches now rely on access to semantic segmentation information, accurate inter-model point-to-point correspondence, and deformation models that characterize the model collections. Existing approaches, however, are either supervised requiring manual labeling; or employ super-linear matching algorithms and thus are unsuited for analyzing large collections spanning many thousands of models. We propose an automatic algorithm that starts with an initial template model and then jointly optimizes for part segmentation, point-to-point surface correspondence, and a compact deformation model to best explain the input model collection. As output, the algorithm produces a set of probabilistic part-based templates that groups the original models into clusters of models capturing their styles and variations. We evaluate our algorithm on several standard datasets and demonstrate its scalability by analyzing much larger collections of up to thousands of shapes.},

We show how this approach can be used in conjunction with existing initialization techniques across a range of application scenarios, including symmetry detection, map refinement across complete shapes, non-rigid partial shape matching and function transfer. In each application we demonstrate an improvement with respect to both the quality of the results and the computational speed compared to the best competing methods, with up to two orders of magnitude speed-up in some applications. We also demonstrate that our method is both robust to noisy input and is scalable with respect to shape complexity.

While this gives users more choice for shape selection, it can be difficult to explore large collections and understand the range of variations amongst the shapes. Exploration is particularly challenging for public shape repositories, which are often only loosely tagged and contain neither point-based nor part-based correspondences. In this paper, we present a method for discovering and exploring continuous variability in a collection of 3D shapes without correspondences. Our method is based on a novel navigation interface that allows users to explore a collection of related shapes by deforming a base template shape through a set of intuitive deformation controls. We also help the user to select the most meaningful deformations using a novel technique for learning shape variability in terms of deformations of the template. Our technique assumes that the set of shapes lies near a low-dimensional manifold in a certain descriptor space, which allows us to avoid establishing correspondences between shapes, while being rotation and scaling invariant. We present results on several shape collections taken directly from public repositories.},

Current state-of-the-art distance measures mostly consider the overall appearance of the shapes and are less sensitive to ﬁne changes in shape structure or geometry. We present shape edit distance (SHED) that measures the amount of effort needed to transform one shape into the other, in terms of rearranging the parts of one shape to match the parts of the other shape, as well as possibly adding and removing parts. The shape edit distance takes into account both the similarity of the overall shape structure and the similarity of individual parts of the shapes. We show that SHED is favorable to state-of-the-art distance measures in a variety of applications and datasets, and is especially successful in scenarios where detecting ﬁne details of the shapes is important, such as shape retrieval and exploration.},

Our difference operator, derived from a shape map, is much more informative than just a scalar global shape similarity score, rendering it useful in a variety of applications where more reﬁned shape comparisons are necessary. The approach is intrinsic and is based on a linear algebraic framework, allowing the use of many common linear algebra tools (e.g, SVD, PCA) for studying a matrix representation of the operator. Remarkably, the formulation allows us not only to localize shape differences on the shapes involved, but also to compare shape differences across pairs of shapes, and to analyze the variability in entire shape collections based on the differences between the shapes. Moreover, while we use a map or correspondence to deﬁne each shape difference, consistent correspondences between the shapes are not necessary for comparing shape differences, although they can be exploited if available. We give a number of applications of shape differences, including parameterizing the intrinsic variability in a shape collection, exploring shape collections using local variability at different scales, performing shape analogies, and aligning shape collections.},

            We argue that full surface correspondence (registration) and optimal deformations (geodesics) are two related problems and propose a framework that solves them simultaneously. We build on the Riemannian shape analysis of anatomical and star‐shaped surfaces of Kurtek et al. and focus on articulated complex shapes that undergo elastic deformations and that may contain missing parts. Our core contribution is the re‐formulation of Kurtek et al.'s approach as a constrained optimization over all possible re‐parameterizations of the surfaces, using a sparse set of corresponding landmarks. We introduce a landmark‐constrained basis, which we use to numerically solve this optimization and therefore establish full surface registration and geodesic deformation between two surfaces. The length of the geodesic provides a measure of dissimilarity between surfaces. The advantages of this approach are: (1) simultaneous computation of full correspondence and geodesic between two surfaces, given a sparse set of matching landmarks (2) ability to handle more comprehensive deformations than nearly isometric, and (3) the geodesics and the geodesic lengths can be further used for symmetrizing 3D shapes and for computing their statistical averages. We validate the framework on challenging cases of large isometric and elastic deformations, and on surfaces with missing parts. We also provide multiple examples of averaging and symmetrizing 3D models.},

	abstract = {As large public repositories of 3D shapes continue to grow, the amount of shape variability in such collections also increases, both in terms of the number of different classes of shapes, as well as the geometric variability of shapes within each class. While this gives users more choice for shape selection, it can be difficult to explore large collections and understand the range of variations amongst the shapes. Exploration is particularly challenging for public shape repositories, which are often only loosely tagged and contain neither point-based nor part-based correspondences. In this paper, we present a method for discovering and exploring continuous variability in a collection of 3D shapes without correspondences. Our method is based on a novel navigation interface that allows users to explore a collection of related shapes by deforming a base template shape through a set of intuitive deformation controls. We also help the user to select the most meaningful deformations using a novel technique for learning shape variability in terms of deformations of the template. Our technique assumes that the set of shapes lies near a low-dimensional manifold in a certain descriptor space, which allows us to avoid establishing correspondences between shapes, while being rotation and scaling invariant. We present results on several shape collections taken directly from public repositories.},

Herein we formalize the Brown/Washington University model of anatomy following the global pattern theory introduced in [1, 2], in which anatomies are represented as deformable templates, collections of 0, 1, 2, 3-dimensional manifolds. Typical structure is carried by the template with the variabilities accommodated via the application of random transformations to the background manifolds. The anatomical model is a quadruple \${\textbackslash}left ( {\textbackslash}Omega , H, I, P {\textbackslash}right )\$, the background space \${\textbackslash}Omega {\textbackslash}dot = \{U\_{\textbackslash}alpha \}\{M\_{\textbackslash}alpha \}\$ of 0, 1, 2, 3-dimensional manifolds, the set of diffeomorphic transformations on the background space \$\{H\} : {\textbackslash}Omega {\textbackslash}leftrightarrow {\textbackslash}Omega\$, the space of idealized medical imagery \$I\$, and \$P\$ the family of probability measures on \$H\$. The group of diffeomorphic transformations \$H\$ is chosen to be rich enough so that a large family of shapes may be generated with the topologies of the template maintained. For normal anatomy one deformable template is studied, with \${\textbackslash}left ( {\textbackslash}Omega , H, I {\textbackslash}right )\$ corresponding to a homogeneous space [3], in that it can be completely generated from one of its elements, \$I = \{HI\_\{temp\}\}, \{I\_\{temp\}\} {\textbackslash}in I\$. For disease, a family of templates \$\{U\_{\textbackslash}alpha \}I\_\{temp\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha\$ are introduced of perhaps varying dimensional transformation classes. The complete anatomy is a collection of homogeneous spaces \$\{I\_\{total\}\} = \{U\_{\textbackslash}alpha \}{\textbackslash}left ( \{I{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha \}, \{H{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha \} {\textbackslash}right )\$.},

	abstract = {In this paper we define a new methodology for shape analysis of parameterized surfaces, where the main issues are: (1) choice of metric for shape comparisons and (2) invariance to reparameterization. We begin by defining a general elastic metric on the space of parameterized surfaces. The main advantages of this metric are twofold. First, it provides a natural interpretation of elastic shape deformations that are being quantified. Second, this metric is invariant under the action of the reparameterization group. We also introduce a novel representation of surfaces termed square root normal fields or SRNFs. This representation is convenient for shape analysis because, under this representation, a reduced version of the general elastic metric becomes the simple \${\textbackslash}ensuremath\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{L\}{\textasciicircum}2\}\$metric. Thus, this transformation greatly simplifies the implementation of our framework. We validate our approach using multiple shape analysis examples for quadrilateral and spherical surfaces. We also compare the current results with those of Kurtek et al. [1]. We show that the proposed method results in more natural shape matchings, and furthermore, has some theoretical advantages over previous methods.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of orientation that naturally arises when representing shapes like curves or surfaces as currents. In the ﬁeld of computational anatomy, the framework of currents has indeed proved very eﬃcient to model a wide variety of shapes. However, in such approaches, orientation of shapes is a fundamental issue that can lead to several drawbacks in treating certain kind of datasets. More speciﬁcally, problems occur with structures like acute pikes because of canceling eﬀects of currents or with data that consists in many disconnected pieces like ﬁber bundles for which currents require a consistent orientation of all pieces. As a promising alternative to currents, varifolds, introduced in the context of geometric measure theory by F. Almgren, allow the representation of any non-oriented manifold (more generally any non-oriented rectiﬁable set). In particular, we explain how varifolds can encode numerically non-oriented objects both from the discrete and continuous point of view. We show various ways to build a Hilbert space structure on the set of varifolds based on the theory of reproducing kernels. We show that, unlike the currents’ setting, these metrics are consistent with shape volume (theorem 4.1) and we derive a formula for the variation of metric with respect to the shape (theorem 4.2). Finally, we propose a generalization to non-oriented shapes of registration algorithms in the context of Large Deformations Metric Mapping (LDDMM), which we detail with a few examples in the last part of the paper.},

	abstract = {In deformable registration, the Riemannian framework – Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping, or LDDMM for short – has inspired numerous techniques for comparing, deforming, averaging and analyzing shapes or images. Grounded in ﬂows of vector ﬁelds, akin to the equations of motion used in ﬂuid dynamics, LDDMM algorithms solve the ﬂow equation in the space of plausible deformations, i.e. diffeomorphisms. In this work, we make use of deep residual neural networks to solve the non-stationary ODE (ﬂow equation) based on an Euler’s discretization scheme. The central idea is to represent time-dependent velocity ﬁelds as fully connected ReLU neural networks (building blocks) and derive optimal weights by minimizing a regularized loss function. Computing minimizing paths between deformations, thus between shapes, turns to ﬁnd optimal network parameters by back-propagating over the intermediate building blocks. Geometrically, at each time step, our algorithm searches for an optimal partition of the space into multiple polytopes, and then computes optimal velocity vectors as afﬁne transformations on each of these polytopes. As a result, different parts of the shape, even if they are close (such as two ﬁngers of a hand), can be made to belong to different polytopes, and therefore be moved in different directions without costing too much energy. Importantly, we show how diffeomorphic transformations, or more precisely bilipshitz transformations, are predicted by our registration algorithm. We illustrate these ideas on diverse registration problems of 3D shapes under complex topology-preserving transformations. We thus provide essential foundations for more advanced shape variability analysis under a novel joint geometric-neural networks Riemannian-like framework, i.e. ResNet-LDDMM.},

	abstract = {Most learning methods for 3D data suffer significant performance drops when the data is not carefully aligned to a canonical orientation. Aligning real world 3D data collected from different sources is non-trivial and requires manual intervention. In this paper, we propose the Adjoint Rigid Transform (ART) Network, a neural module which can be integrated with a variety of 3D networks to significantly boost their performance. ART learns to rotate input shapes to a learned canonical orientation, which is crucial for a lot of tasks such as shape reconstruction, interpolation, non-rigid registration, and latent disentanglement. ART achieves this with self-supervision and a rotation equivariance constraint on predicted rotations. With only self-supervision, ART facilitates learning a canonical orientation for both rigid and nonrigid shapes, which leads to a notable boost in performance of aforementioned tasks. Our code and model are available at [2].},

	abstract = {Statistical shape models are a useful tool in image processing and computer vision. A Procrustres registration of the contours of the same shape is typically perform to align the training samples to learn the statistical shape model. A Procrustes registration between two contours with known correspondences is straightforward. However, these correspondences are not generally available. Manually placed landmarks are often used for correspondence in the design of statistical shape models. However, determining manual landmarks on the contours is timeconsuming and often error-prone. One solution to simultaneously ﬁnd correspondence and registration is the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. However, ICP requires an initial position of the contours that is close to registration, and it is not robust against outliers. We propose a new strategy, based on Dynamic Time Warping, that efﬁciently solves the Procrustes registration problem without correspondences. We study the registration performance in a collection of different shape data sets and show that our technique outperforms competing techniques based on the ICP approach. Our strategy is applied to an ensemble of contours of the same shape as an extension of the generalized Procrustes analysis accounting for a lack of correspondence.},

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

	abstract = {Estimating homography matrix between two images has various applications like image stitching or image mosaicing and spatial information retrieval from multiple camera views, but has been proved to be a complicated problem, especially in cases of radically different camera poses and zoom factors. Many relevant approaches have been proposed, utilizing direct feature based, or deep learning methodologies. In this paper, we propose a generalized RANSAC algorithm, H-RANSAC, to retrieve homography image transformations from sets of points without descriptive local feature vectors and point pairing. We allow the points to be optionally labelled in two classes. We propose a robust criterion that rejects implausible point selection before each iteration of RANSAC, based on the type of the quadrilaterals formed by random point pair selection (convex or concave and (non)-self-intersecting). A similar post-hoc criterion rejects implausible homography transformations is included at the end of each iteration. The expected maximum iterations of \$H\$-RANSAC are derived for different probabilities of success, according to the number of points per image and per class, and the percentage of outliers. The proposed methodology is tested on a large dataset of images acquired by 12 cameras during real football matches, where radically different views at each timestamp are to be matched. Comparisons with state-of-the-art implementations of RANSAC combined with classic and deep learning image salient point detection indicates the superiority of the proposed \$H\$-RANSAC, in terms of average reprojection error and number of successfully processed pairs of frames, rendering it the method of choice in cases of image homography alignment with few tens of points, while local features are not available, or not descriptive enough. The implementation of \$H\$-RANSAC is available in https://github.com/gnousias/H-RANSAC},

The method handles the full six-degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and experience shows that the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. For examples, a given 'model' shape and a sensed 'data' shape that represents a major portion of the model shape can be registered in minutes by testing one initial translation and a relatively small set of rotations to allow for the given level of model complexity. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. The described method is also useful for deciding fundamental issues such as the congruence (shape equivalence) of different geometric representations as well as for estimating the motion between point sets where the correspondences are not known. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.},

An understanding of functionality is important in enabling such modeling tools. Given that the majority of man-made artifacts are designed to serve a certain function, the functionality of objects is often reﬂected by their geometry, the way that they are organized in an environment, and their interaction with other objects or agents. Thus, in recent years, a variety of methods in shape analysis have been developed to extract functional information about objects and scenes from these different types of cues. In this report, we discuss recent developments that incorporate functionality aspects into the analysis of 3D shapes and scenes. We provide a summary of the state-of-the-art in this area, including a discussion of key ideas and an organized review of the relevant literature. More speciﬁcally, the report is structured around a general deﬁnition of functionality from which we derive criteria for classifying the body of prior work. This deﬁnition also facilitates a comparative view of methods for functionality analysis. We focus on studying the inference of functionality from a geometric perspective, and pose functionality analysis as a process involving both the geometry and interactions of a functional entity. In addition, we discuss a variety of applications that beneﬁt from an analysis of functionality, and conclude the report with a discussion of current challenges and potential future works.},

	abstract = {The field of 3D face modeling has a large gap between high-end and low-end methods. At the high end, the best facial animation is indistinguishable from real humans, but this comes at the cost of extensive manual labor. At the low end, face capture from consumer depth sensors relies on 3D face models that are not expressive enough to capture the variability in natural facial shape and expression. We seek a middle ground by learning a facial model from thousands of accurately aligned 3D scans. Our FLAME model (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions) is designed to work with existing graphics software and be easy to fit to data. FLAME uses a linear shape space trained from 3800 scans of human heads. FLAME combines this linear shape space with an articulated jaw, neck, and eyeballs, pose-dependent corrective blendshapes, and additional global expression blendshapes. The pose and expression dependent articulations are learned from 4D face sequences in the D3DFACS dataset along with additional 4D sequences. We accurately register a template mesh to the scan sequences and make the D3DFACS registrations available for research purposes. In total the model is trained from over 33, 000 scans. FLAME is low-dimensional but more expressive than the FaceWarehouse model and the Basel Face Model. We compare FLAME to these models by fitting them to static 3D scans and 4D sequences using the same optimization method. FLAME is significantly more accurate and is available for research purposes (http://flame.is.tue.mpg.de).},

Traditional models learn a latent representation of a face using linear subspaces or higher-order tensor generalizations. Due to this linearity, they can not capture extreme deformations and nonlinear expressions. To address this, we introduce a versatile model that learns a non-linear representation of a face using spectral convolutions on a mesh surface. We introduce mesh sampling operations that enable a hierarchical mesh representation that captures non-linear variations in shape and expression at multiple scales within the model. In a variational setting, our model samples diverse realistic 3D faces from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Our training data consists of 20,466 meshes of extreme expressions captured over 12 diﬀerent subjects. Despite limited training data, our trained model outperforms state-of-the-art face models with 50\% lower reconstruction error, while using 75\% fewer parameters. We show that, replacing the expression space of an existing state-of-theart face model with our model, achieves a lower reconstruction error.

For example, all possible bendings of a given surface that includes all length preserving deformations without tearing or stretching the surface are considered to be isometric. We present a method to construct a bending invariant signature for such surfaces. This invariant representation is an embedding of the geometric structure of the surface in a small dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are approximated by Euclidean ones. The bending invariant representation is constructed by first measuring the intergeodesic distances between uniformly distributed points on the surface. Next, a multidimensional scaling technique is applied to extract coordinates in a finite dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are replaced by Euclidean ones. Applying this transform to various surfaces with similar geodesic structures (first fundamental form) maps them into similar signature surfaces. We thereby translate the problem of matching nonrigid objects in various postures into a simpler problem of matching rigid objects. As an example, we show a simple surface classification method that uses our bending invariant signatures.},

	abstract = {The goal of our work is to develop an algorithm for automatic and robust detection of global intrinsic symmetries in 3D surface meshes. Our approach is based on two core observations. First, symmetry invariant point sets can be detected robustly using critical points of the Average Geodesic Distance (AGD) function. Second, intrinsic symmetries are self-isometries of surfaces and as such are contained in the low dimensional group of Möbius transformations. Based on these observations, we propose an algorithm that: 1) generates a set of symmetric points by detecting critical points of the AGD function, 2) enumerates small subsets of those feature points to generate candidate Möbius transformations,and 3) selects among those candidate Möbius transformations the one(s) that best map the surface onto itself. The main advantages of this algorithm stem from the stability of the AGD in predicting potential symmetric point features and the low dimensionality of the Möbius group for enumerating potential self-mappings. During experiments with a benchmark set of meshes augmented with human-speciﬁed symmetric correspondences, we ﬁnd that the algorithm is able to ﬁnd intrinsic symmetries for a wide variety of object types with moderate deviations from perfect symmetry.},

	doi = {10.1145/2010324.1964974},
	abstract = {This paper describes a fully automatic pipeline for finding an intrinsic map between two non-isometric, genus zero surfaces. Our approach is based on the observation that efficient methods exist to search for nearly isometric maps (e.g., Möbius Voting or Heat Kernel Maps), but no single solution found with these methods provides low-distortion everywhere for pairs of surfaces differing by large deformations. To address this problem, we suggest using a weighted combination of these maps to produce a "blended map." This approach enables algorithms that leverage efficient search procedures, yet can provide the flexibility to handle large deformations.
The main challenges of this approach lie in finding a set of candidate maps \{ m i \} and their associated blending weights \{ b i ( p )\} for every point p on the surface. We address these challenges specifically for conformal maps by making the following contributions. First, we provide a way to blend maps, defining the image of p as the weighted geodesic centroid of m i ( p ). Second, we provide a definition for smooth blending weights at every point p that are proportional to the area preservation of m i at p . Third, we solve a global optimization problem that selects candidate maps based both on their area preservation and consistency with other selected maps. During experiments with these methods, we find that our algorithm produces blended maps that align semantic features better than alternative approaches over a variety of data sets.},

	abstract = {Isometric surfaces share the same geometric structure, also known as the "first fundamental form." For example, all possible bendings of a given surface that includes all length preserving deformations without tearing or stretching the surface are considered to be isometric. We present a method to construct a bending invariant signature for such surfaces. This invariant representation is an embedding of the geometric structure of the surface in a small dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are approximated by Euclidean ones. The bending invariant representation is constructed by first measuring the intergeodesic distances between uniformly distributed points on the surface. Next, a multidimensional scaling technique is applied to extract coordinates in a finite dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are replaced by Euclidean ones. Applying this transform to various surfaces with similar geodesic structures (first fundamental form) maps them into similar signature surfaces. We thereby translate the problem of matching nonrigid objects in various postures into a simpler problem of matching rigid objects. As an example, we show a simple surface classification method that uses our bending invariant signatures.},

A number of algorithms have been proposed, among which random-sampling-based techniques have been particularly successful due to their generality and efficiency. We introduce a new sampling-based shape matching algorithm that uses a planning step to find optimized “landmark” points. These points are matched first in order to maximize the information gained and thus minimize the sampling costs. Our approach makes three main contributions: First, the new technique leads to a significant improvement in performance, which we demonstrate on a number of benchmark scenarios. Second, our technique does not require any keypoint detection. This is often a significant limitation for models that do not show sufficient surface features. Third, we examine the actual numerical degrees of freedom of the matching problem for a given piece of geometry. In contrast to previous results, our estimates take into account unprecise geodesics and potentially numerically unfavorable geometry of general topology, giving a more realistic complexity estimate.},

Surface registration is important for building full 3D models from partial scans, creating statistical shape models, shape retrieval, and tracking. The problem is particularly challenging for non-rigid and articulated objects like human bodies. While the challenges of real-world data registration are not present in existing synthetic datasets, establishing ground-truth correspondences for real 3D scans is difﬁcult. We address this with a novel mesh registration technique that combines 3D shape and appearance information to produce high-quality alignments. We deﬁne a new dataset called FAUST that contains 300 scans of 10 people in a wide range of poses together with an evaluation methodology. To achieve accurate registration, we paint the subjects with high-frequency textures and use an extensive validation process to ensure accurate ground truth. We ﬁnd that current shape registration methods have trouble with this real-world data. The dataset and evaluation website are available for research purposes at http://faust.is.tue.mpg.de.},

A feature of skeletal matching is the ability to perform part-matching, and its inherent intuitiveness, which helps in deﬁning the search and in visualizing the results.

	abstract = {This paper challenges the difﬁcult problem of automatic semantic correspondence between two given shapes which are semantically similar but possibly geometrically very different (e.g., a dog and an elephant). We argue that the challenging part is the establishment of a sparse correspondence and show that it can be efﬁciently solved by considering the underlying skeletons augmented with intrinsic surface information. To avoid potentially costly direct search for the best combinatorial match between two sets of skeletal feature nodes, we introduce a statistical correspondence algorithm based on a novel voting scheme, which we call electors voting. The electors are a rather large set of correspondences which then vote to synthesize the ﬁnal correspondence. The electors are selected via a combinatorial search with pruning tests designed to quickly ﬁlter out a vast majority of bad correspondence. This voting scheme is both efﬁcient and insensitive to parameter and threshold settings. The effectiveness of the method is validated by precision-recall statistics with respect to manually deﬁned ground truth. We show that high quality correspondences can be instantaneously established for a wide variety of model pairs, which may have different poses, surface details, and only partial semantic correspondence.},

	abstract = {We present the Regensburg Breast Shape Model (RBSM) – a 3D statistical shape model of the female breast built from 110 breast scans acquired in a standing position, and the ﬁrst publicly available. Together with the model, a fully automated, pairwise surface registration pipeline used to establish dense correspondence among 3D breast scans is introduced. Our method is computationally eﬃcient and requires only four landmarks to guide the registration process. A major challenge when modeling female breasts from surface-only 3D breast scans is the non-separability of breast and thorax. In order to weaken the strong coupling between breast and surrounding areas, we propose to minimize the variance outside the breast region as much as possible. To achieve this goal, a novel concept called breast probability masks (BPMs) is introduced. A BPM assigns probabilities to each point of a 3D breast scan, telling how likely it is that a particular point belongs to the breast area. During registration, we use BPMs to align the template to the target as accurately as possible inside the breast region and only roughly outside. This simple yet eﬀective strategy signiﬁcantly reduces the unwanted variance outside the breast region, leading to better statistical shape models in which breast shapes are quite well decoupled from the thorax. The RBSM is thus able to produce a variety of diﬀerent breast shapes as independently as possible from the shape of the thorax. Our systematic experimental evaluation reveals a generalization ability of 0.17 mm and a speciﬁcity of 2.8 mm. To underline the expressiveness of the proposed model, we ﬁnally demonstrate in two showcase applications how the RBSM can be used for surgical outcome simulation and the prediction of a missing breast from the remaining one. Our model is available at https://www.rbsm.re-mic.de/.},

Unlike the majority of prior work which focuses on discovering maps in the context of shape matching, our main focus is on evaluating, analyzing and visualizing a given map, and the distortion(s) it introduces, in an efﬁcient and intuitive way. We are motivated primarily by the fact that most existing metrics for map evaluation are quadratic and expensive to compute in practice, and that current map visualization techniques are suitable primarily for global map understanding, and typically do not highlight areas where the map fails to meet certain quality criteria in a multi-scale way. We propose to address these challenges in a uniﬁed way by considering the functional representation of a map, and performing spectral analysis on this representation. In particular, we propose a simple multi-scale method for map evaluation and visualization, which provides detailed multi-scale information about the distortion induced by a map, which can be used alongside existing global visualization techniques.},

Starting from a sequence of multi-view video plus depth (MVD) data, the proposed quad-based representation takes into account, in a uniﬁed manner, diﬀerent issues such as compactness, compression, and intermediate view synthesis. The representation is extracted from MVD data in two steps. First, a set of 3D quads is extracted thanks to quadtree decomposition performed on depth maps. Second, a selective elimination of the quads is performed in order to reduce inter-view redundancies and thus provide a compact representation. Moreover, the proposed methodology for extracting the representation allows to reduce ghosting artifacts. Finally, an adapted compression technique is proposed that limits coding artifacts. The results presented on two real sequences show that the proposed representation provides a good trade-oﬀ between rendering quality and data compactness.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Image-based navigation is widely considered the next frontier of minimally invasive surgery. It is believed that image-based navigation will increase the access to reproducible, safe, and high-precision surgery as it may then be performed at acceptable costs and effort. This is because image-based techniques avoid the need of specialized equipment and seamlessly integrate with contemporary workflows. Furthermore, it is expected that image-based navigation techniques will play a major role in enabling mixed reality environments, as well as autonomous and robot-assisted workflows. A critical component of image guidance is 2D/3D registration, a technique to estimate the spatial relationships between 3D structures, e.g., preoperative volumetric imagery or models of surgical instruments, and 2D images thereof, such as intraoperative X-ray fluoroscopy or endoscopy. While image-based 2D/3D registration is a mature technique, its transition from the bench to the bedside has been restrained by well-known challenges, including brittleness with respect to optimization objective, hyperparameter selection, and initialization, difficulties in dealing with inconsistencies or multiple objects, and limited single-view performance. One reason these challenges persist today is that analytical solutions are likely inadequate considering the complexity, variability, and high-dimensionality of generic 2D/3D registration problems. The recent advent of machine learning-based approaches to imaging problems that, rather than specifying the desired functional mapping, approximate it using highly expressive parametric models holds promise for solving some of the notorious challenges in 2D/3D registration. In this manuscript, we review the impact of machine learning on 2D/3D registration to systematically summarize the recent advances made by introduction of this novel technology. Grounded in these insights, we then offer our perspective on the most pressing needs, significant open problems, and possible next steps.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This work presents a different approach to represent and learn the shape from a given point set. The key idea is to impose structure on the point set by multiple random walks through the cloud for exploring different regions of the 3D object. Then we learn a per-point and per-walk representation and aggregate multiple walk predictions at inference. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for two 3D shape analysis tasks: classiﬁcation and retrieval. Furthermore, we propose a shape complexity indicator function that uses crosswalk and inter-walk variance measures to subdivide the shape space.},

As in many other applications in computer vision, deep learning-based methods were quickly applied to 3D data classification and have become the state-of-the-art in this area. More recently, capsule networks, which are novel neural structures, have been introduced to enhance the ability of neural networks to better capture the parts-relationship, which yields more accurate classification with less training data. Moreover, deploying deep machine learning models on mobile platforms requires the models to be optimized due to limited memory and computational constraints. In this work, we propose methods to boost the accuracies of a standard 3D CNN-based and a Capsule Network-based classifier, help the training to better generalize the data distribution with limited data, and optimize the models for resource-constrained environments, such as mobile platforms. We also show that the introduction of capsules to 3D object classification pipeline improves the classification performance with limited training data, while a specifically optimized weight pruning method keeps the model compact enough for mobile deployment. Our broad spectrum of experiments show that proposed methods improve the performance of the base model while significantly reducing the memory and computation requirements.},

By modifying the network and the way models are evaluated, we can directly compare the merits of voxels vs. surfaces and viewercentered vs. object-centered for familiar vs. unfamiliar objects, as predicted from RGB or depth images. Among our ﬁndings, we show that surface-based methods outperform voxel representations for objects from novel classes and produce higher resolution outputs. We also ﬁnd that using viewer-centered coordinates is advantageous for novel objects, while object-centered representations are better for more familiar objects. Interestingly, the coordinate frame signiﬁcantly affects the shape representation learned, with object-centered placing more importance on implicitly recognizing the object category and viewer-centered producing shape representations with less dependence on category recognition.},

	abstract = {Spectral embedding is a powerful graph embedding technique that has received a lot of attention recently due to its effectiveness on Graph Transformers. However, from a theoretical perspective, the universal expressive power of spectral embedding comes at the price of losing two important invariance properties of graphs, sign and basis invariance, which also limits its effectiveness on graph data. To remedy this issue, many previous methods developed costly approaches to learn new invariants and suffer from high computation complexity. In this work, we explore a minimal approach that resolves the ambiguity issues by directly finding canonical directions for the eigenvectors, named Laplacian Canonization (LC). As a pure pre-processing method, LC is light-weighted and can be applied to any existing GNNs. We provide a thorough investigation, from theory to algorithm, on this approach, and discover an efficient algorithm named Maximal Axis Projection (MAP) that works for both sign and basis invariance and successfully canonizes more than 90\% of all eigenvectors. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets like ZINC, MOLTOX21, and MOLPCBA show that MAP consistently outperforms existing methods while bringing minimal computation overhead.

We show how this approach can be used in conjunction with existing initialization techniques across a range of application scenarios, including symmetry detection, map refinement across complete shapes, non-rigid partial shape matching and function transfer. In each application we demonstrate an improvement with respect to both the quality of the results and the computational speed compared to the best competing methods, with up to two orders of magnitude speed-up in some applications. We also demonstrate that our method is both robust to noisy input and is scalable with respect to shape complexity.

	abstract = {We develop a novel formulation for the notion of shape differences, aimed at providing detailed information about the location and nature of the differences or distortions between the two shapes being compared. Our difference operator, derived from a shape map, is much more informative than just a scalar global shape similarity score, rendering it useful in a variety of applications where more reﬁned shape comparisons are necessary. The approach is intrinsic and is based on a linear algebraic framework, allowing the use of many common linear algebra tools (e.g, SVD, PCA) for studying a matrix representation of the operator. Remarkably, the formulation allows us not only to localize shape differences on the shapes involved, but also to compare shape differences across pairs of shapes, and to analyze the variability in entire shape collections based on the differences between the shapes. Moreover, while we use a map or correspondence to deﬁne each shape difference, consistent correspondences between the shapes are not necessary for comparing shape differences, although they can be exploited if available. We give a number of applications of shape differences, including parameterizing the intrinsic variability in a shape collection, exploring shape collections using local variability at different scales, performing shape analogies, and aligning shape collections.},

	abstract = {3D shape matching is a long-standing problem in computer vision and computer graphics. While deep neural networks were shown to lead to state-of-the-art results in shape matching, existing learning-based approaches are limited in the context of multi-shape matching: (i) either they focus on matching pairs of shapes only and thus suffer from cycle-inconsistent multi-matchings, or (ii) they require an explicit template shape to address the matching of a collection of shapes. In this paper, we present a novel approach for deep multi-shape matching that ensures cycle-consistent multi-matchings while not depending on an explicit template shape. To this end, we utilise a shape-to-universe multi-matching representation that we combine with powerful functional map regularisation, so that our multi-shape matching neural network can be trained in a fully unsupervised manner. While the functional map regularisation is only considered during training time, functional maps are not computed for predicting correspondences, thereby allowing for fast inference. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging benchmark datasets, and, most remarkably, that our unsupervised method even outperforms recent supervised methods.},

In the literature, embedding alignment has not been defined formally, explored theoretically, or analyzed empirically. Here, we explore the embedding alignment and its parts, provide the first formal definitions, propose novel metrics to measure alignment and stability, and show their suitability through synthetic experiments. Real-world experiments show that both static and dynamic RL methods are prone to produce misaligned embeddings and such misalignment worsens the performance of dynamic network inference tasks. By ensuring alignment, the prediction accuracy raises by up to 90\% in static and by 40\% in dynamic RL methods.},

	abstract = {Finding an informative, structure-preserving map between two shapes has been a long-standing problem in geometry processing, involving a variety of solution approaches and applications. However, in many cases, we are given not only two related shapes, but a collection of them, and considering each pairwise map independently does not take full advantage of all existing information. For example, a notorious problem with computing shape maps is the ambiguity introduced by the symmetry problem — for two similar shapes which have reﬂectional symmetry there exist two maps which are equally favorable, and no intrinsic mapping algorithm can distinguish between them based on these two shapes alone. Another prominent issue with shape mapping algorithms is their relative sensitivity to how “similar” two shapes are — good maps are much easier to obtain when shapes are very similar. Given the context of additional shape maps connecting our collection, we propose to add the constraint of global map consistency, requiring that any composition of maps between two shapes should be independent of the path chosen in the network. This requirement can help us choose among the equally good symmetric alternatives, or help us replace a “bad” pairwise map with the composition of a few “good” maps between shapes that in some sense interpolate the original ones. We show how, given a collection of pairwise shape maps, to deﬁne an optimization problem whose output is a set of alternative maps, compositions of those given, which are consistent, and individually at times much better than the original. Our method is general, and can work on any collection of shapes, as long as a seed set of good pairwise maps is provided. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for improving maps generated by state-of-the-art mapping methods on various shape databases.},

Errors in the approximations are controlled by theoretical upper bounds assessing the range of applicability of our pipeline. With this construction in hand, we propose a scalable practical algorithm and demonstrate results on dense meshes, which approximate those obtained by standard functional map algorithms at the fraction of the computation time. Moreover, our approach outperforms the standard acceleration procedures by a large margin, leading to accurate results even in challenging cases.},

Our method can capture local changes in geometric structure, in contrast to methods based, for instance, on global shape descriptors. As such, our approach allows to perform automatic shape classification and provides visual feedback on shape regions associated with different classes of deformations.

While intrinsic methods based on functional maps can produce high-quality correspondences, they work under isometric assumptions and become unreliable for garment deformations which are highly non-isometric. To achieve wrinkle-level as well as texture-level alignment, we present a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage method that leverages intrinsic manifold properties with two neural deformation fields, in the 3D space and the intrinsic space, respectively. The coarse stage performs a 3D fitting, where we leverage intrinsic manifold properties to define a manifold deformation field. The coarse fitting then induces a functional map that produces an alignment of intrinsic embeddings. We further refine the intrinsic alignment with a second neural deformation field for higher accuracy. We evaluate our method with our captured garment dataset, GarmCap. The method achieves accurate wrinklelevel and texture-level alignment and works for difficult garment types such as long coats.

	abstract = {Shape matching is a fundamental problem in computer graphics with many applications. Functional maps translate the point-wise shape-matching problem into its functional counterpart and have inspired numerous solutions over the last decade. Nearly all the solutions based on functional maps rely on the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LB) to describe the functional spaces deﬁned on the surfaces and then convert the functional correspondences into point-wise correspondences. However, this ﬁnal step is often error-prone and inaccurate in tiny regions and protrusions, where the energy of LB does not uniformly cover the surface. We propose a new functional basis Principal Components of a Dictionary (PCD) to address such intrinsic limitation. PCD constructs an orthonormal basis from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of a dictionary of functions deﬁned over the shape. These dictionaries can target speciﬁc properties of the ﬁnal basis, such as achieving an even spreading of energy. Our experimental evaluation compares seven diﬀerent dictionaries on established benchmarks, showing that PCD is suited to target diﬀerent shape-matching scenarios, resulting in more accurate point-wise maps than the LB basis when used in the same pipeline. This evidence provides a promising alternative for improving correspondence estimation, conﬁrming the power and ﬂexibility of functional maps.},

Each pyramid level, denoted by a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP), takes as input a sinusoidally encoded 3D point and outputs its motion increments from the previous level. The sinusoidal function starts with a low input frequency and gradually increases when the pyramid level goes down. This allows a multi-level rigid to nonrigid motion decomposition and also speeds up the solving by 50 times compared to the existing MLP-based approach.

Under this hard constraint, our solver obtains functional maps with lower energy values compared to the standard continuous strategies. Perhaps more importantly, the recovered pointwise maps from our discrete solver preserve the optimized for functional properties and are thus of higher overall quality. We demonstrate the advantages of our discrete solver on a range of energies and shape categories, compared to existing techniques for promoting pointwise maps within the functional map framework.

In this paper, we step back and investigate the contribution made by the Transformer-encoder architecture compared to its more recent alternatives, focusing on why and how it works on this specific task. Thanks to the versatility of our implementation, we can harness the bi-directional structure of the correspondence problem, making it more interpretable.

	abstract = {We present SpecTrHuMS, a Spectral Transformer for 3D triangular Human Mesh Sequence learning which combines known deep learning models with spectral mesh processing to capture characteristics of 3D shapes as well as temporal dependencies between the frames. Unlike previous works in this field, our approach is able to work directly with a compressed representation of the geometry, the spectral coefficients, rather than relying solely on skeleton joints that does not contain surface information. The vertices of each mesh of a sequence are first projected on the eigenvectors of the Graph Laplacian computed from the common triangulation. A convolutional encoder then encodes each frame into lower dimensional latent variables that preserve as much as possible the spectral information. These latent variables are next passed through a transformer architecture so that the model understands the context of the sequence and learns temporal dependencies between the frames. Each frame of the transformer’s output is then decoded by a convolutional decoder which aims to reconstruct the input spectral coefficients. Finally, all frames are transformed back into the spatial domain, resulting in a general process able to treat 4D surfaces with a constant connectivity. Our method is evaluated on a prediction task on AMASS, a dataset of human surface sequences, showing the ability of our model to produce realistic movements while preserving the identity of a subject, and showing that this work is a significant step towards efficient and high-quality representation of triangular mesh sequences with constant connectivity. Additional experiments show that our model can be easily extended to other tasks such as long term prediction, completion and that it is generalizable to other datasets with constant connectivity. This work opens up new possibilities for applications in the fields of animation, virtual reality, and computer graphics. Pretrained models, the code to train them and the code to create datasets are available at https://github.com/MEPPteam/SpecTrHuMS.},

While theoretically the answer to this question is negative (there exist examples of iso-spectral but non-isometric manifolds), little is known about the practical possibility of using the spectrum for shape reconstruction and optimization. In this paper, we introduce a numerical procedure called isospectralization, consisting of deforming one shape to make its Laplacian spectrum match that of another. We implement the isospectralization procedure using modern differentiable programming techniques and exemplify its applications in some of the classical and notoriously hard problems in geometry processing, computer vision, and graphics such as shape reconstruction, pose and style transfer, and dense deformable correspondence.},

	abstract = {We present an unsupervised data-driven approach for non-rigid shape matching. Shape matching identifies correspondences between two shapes and is a fundamental step in many computer vision and graphics applications. Our approach is designed to be particularly robust when matching shapes digitized using 3D scanners that contain fine geometric detail and suffer from different types of noise including topological noise caused by the coalescence of spatially close surface regions. We build on two strategies. First, using a hierarchical patch based shape representation we match shapes consistently in a coarse to fine manner, allowing for robustness to noise. This multi-scale representation drastically reduces the dimensionality of the problem when matching at the coarsest scale, rendering unsupervised learning feasible. Second, we constrain this hierarchical matching to be reflected in 3D by fitting a patch-wise near-rigid deformation model. Using this constraint, we leverage spatial continuity at different scales to capture global shape properties, resulting in matchings that generalize well to data with different deformations and noise characteristics. Experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains significantly better results on raw 3D scans than state-of-the-art methods, while performing on-par on standard test scenarios.},

In this work, we introduce a new approach for refining non-rigid correspondences among a collection of 3D shapes undergoing non-rigid deformation. Our approach incorporates a Region Of Interest (ROI) into the refinement process, which is specified by the user on one shape within the collection. Based on the functional map framework and more specifically on the notion of cycle-consistency, our formulation improves the overall matching consistency while prioritizing that of the region of interest. Specifically, the initial pairwise correspondences are refined by first defining the localized harmonics that are confined within the transferred ROI on each shape, and subsequently applying the CCLB (Canonical Consistent Latent Basis) framework both on the global and the localized harmonics. This leads to an enhanced matching accuracy for both the ROIs and the overall shapes across the collection. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real scan datasets, in comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques.},

In this paper, we introduce a new framework for local spectral shape analysis. We show how to efficiently construct localized orthogonal bases by solving an optimization problem that in turn can be posed as the eigendecomposition of a new operator obtained by a modification of the standard Laplacian. We study the theoretical and computational aspects of the proposed framework and showcase our new construction on the classical problems of shape approximation and correspondence.

Our Skinned Multi-Person Linear model (SMPL) is a skinned vertex-based model that accurately represents a wide variety of body shapes in natural human poses. The parameters of the model are learned from data including the rest pose template, blend weights, pose-dependent blend shapes, identity-dependent blend shapes, and a regressor from vertices to joint locations. Unlike previous models, the pose-dependent blend shapes are a linear function of the elements of the pose rotation matrices. This simple formulation enables training the entire model from a relatively large number of aligned 3D meshes of different people in different poses. We quantitatively evaluate variants of SMPL using linear or dual-quaternion blend skinning and show that both are more accurate than a Blend-SCAPE model trained on the same data. We also extend SMPL to realistically model dynamic soft-tissue deformations. Because it is based on blend skinning, SMPL is compatible with existing rendering engines and we make it available for research purposes.},

	abstract = {In megavoltage photon radiotherapy, accurate knowledge of the absorbed dose in the build-up region is essential in the clinical management of skin toxicity and superficial target coverage. These build-up doses strongly depend on a wide range of treatment parameters and evolve, consequently, in close relation with treatment technology. Commercial treatment planning systems and multiple dosimetric techniques, however, fail to accurately predict buildup doses. In this respect, this dissertation investigated the impact of recent evolutions in megavoltage photon radiotherapy on the absorbed dose and calculation accuracy in the build-up region. 
To that purpose, we first compared and optimized the performance of two transmission scanners for radiochromic film dosimetry in the high dose gradient of the build-up region. The Nikon Coolscan 9000ED scanner (Nikon Co., Tokyo, Japan) was identified as the preferential tool for high-gradient dosimetry, mainly due to its high sensitivity resulting in more contrast in the digitized image. The main limitation of the Nikon digitizer is its film size restriction to 6.2x20 cm². 
Secondly, we focussed on flattening filter-free linear accelerators, which currently face swift implementation into clinical practice because of their increased dose rate and reduction in head scatter compared to conventional designs. Our study demonstrated that build-up doses in flattening filter-free beams provided by standard linear accelerators slightly exceed build-up doses in conventional beams, indicating that the shift of the X-ray spectrum to lower energies in flattening filter-free mode is nearly compensated by the reduction of electron contamination and head scatter. In literature, the reduction in electron contamination in flattening-filter free mode is often anticipated to improve build-up calculation accuracy, as treatment planning systems generally use simple electron contamination models. For the XVMC code implemented in the Monaco treatment planning system however, considerable differences between build-up measurements and calculations were detected in both flattened and unflattened beams, emphasizing the importance of other factors that negatively affect build-up calculation accuracy. 
Thirdly, this dissertation investigated the dosimetric impact of patient positioning devices, which are increasingly used to ensure set-up accuracy while delivering highly conformal dose distributions. The presence of the components of the AIO patient positioning device (Orfit Industries, Wijnegem, Belgium) was found to cause considerable and clinically relevant build-up dose increases. Integration of the device CT data into treatment planning allowed to accurately model the most important attenuation effects, but failed to accurately predict build-up doses. 
Finally, we investigated the potential of modern volumetric arc techniques (VMAT) to intentionally reduce the superficial dose to the hair follicles and prevent temporary alopecia in whole brain radiotherapy. Compared to the standard opposed fields techniques, VMAT was shown to considerably reduce the subcutaneously absorbed dose (20.5\% on average), mainly on the top and the back of the skull (41.8\% on average). Accordingly, the mean hair loss in the study subjects in a prospective phase II trial was the least pronounced on the top and the back of the skull.},

We propose a novel approach for direct map computation between triangle meshes without mapping to an intermediate domain, which optimizes for the harmonicity and reversibility of the forward and backward maps. Our method is general both in the information it can receive as input, e.g. point landmarks, a dense map or a functional map, and in the diversity of the geometries to which it can be applied. We demonstrate that our maps exhibit lower conformal distortion than the state-of-the-art, while succeeding in correctly mapping key features of the input shapes.},

The data however, while corresponding to the same anatomy, are often very different in topology or shape and might only partially match each other. We introduce a new asymmetric data dissimilarity term for various geometric shapes like sets of curves or surfaces. This term is based on the Varifold shape representation and assesses the embedding of a shape into another one without relying on correspondences between points. It is designed as data attachment for the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework, allowing to compute meaningful deformation of one shape onto a subset of the other. Registrations are illustrated on sets of synthetic 3D curves, real vascular trees and livers’ surfaces from two different modalities: Computed Tomography (CT) and Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). All experiments show that this data dissimilarity term leads to coherent partial matching despite the topological differences.},

	abstract = {In deformable registration, the geometric framework -- large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (or LDDMM, in short) -- has inspired numerous techniques for comparing, deforming, averaging and analyzing shapes or images. In this work, we make use of deep residual neural networks to solve the non-stationary ODE (flow equation) based on a Eulers discretization scheme. The central idea is to represent time-dependent velocity fields as fully connected ReLU neural networks (building blocks) and derive optimal weights by minimizing a regularized loss function. Computing minimizing paths between deformations, thus between shapes, turns to find optimal network parameters by back-propagating over the intermediate building blocks. Geometrically, at each time step, ResNet-LDDMM searches for an optimal partition of the space into multiple polytopes, and then computes optimal velocity vectors as affine transformations on each of these polytopes. As a result, different parts of the shape, even if they are close, can be made to belong to different polytopes, and therefore be moved in different directions without costing too much energy. Importantly, we show how diffeomorphic transformations, or more precisely bilipshitz transformations, are predicted by our algorithm. We illustrate these ideas on diverse registration problems of 3D shapes under complex topology-preserving transformations.},

	abstract = {In this work, we address the problem of 4D facial expressions generation. This is usually addressed by animating a neutral 3D face to reach an expression peak, and then get back to the neutral state. In the real world though, people show more complex expressions, and switch from one expression to another. We thus propose a new model that generates transitions between different expressions, and synthesizes long and composed 4D expressions. This involves three sub-problems: (i) modeling the temporal dynamics of expressions, (ii) learning transitions between them, and (iii) deforming a generic mesh. We propose to encode the temporal evolution of expressions using the motion of a set of 3D landmarks, that we learn to generate by training a manifold-valued GAN (Motion3DGAN). To allow the generation of composed expressions, this model accepts two labels encoding the starting and the ending expressions. The final sequence of meshes is generated by a Sparse2Dense mesh Decoder (S2D-Dec) that maps the landmark displacements to a dense, per-vertex displacement of a known mesh topology. By explicitly working with motion trajectories, the model is totally independent from the identity. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show that our proposed approach brings significant improvements with respect to previous solutions, while retaining good generalization to unseen data.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyse different treatment techniques with conventional photon beams, intensity modulated photon beams, and proton beams for intact breast irradiation for patients in whom conventional irradiation would cause potentially dangerous lung irradiation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five breast cancer patients with highly concave breast tissue volume around the lung were considered at planning level in order to assess the suitability of different irradiation techniques. Three-dimensional dose distributions for conventional two-field tangential photon treatment, two-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), three-field non-IMRT, three-field IMRT, and single-field proton treatment were investigated, aiming at assessing the possibility to reduce lung irradiation below risk levels. Analysis of dose-volume histograms and related physical and biological parameters (significant minimum, maximum and mean doses, conformity indexes and equivalent uniform dose (EUD)) for planned target volume (PTV) and lung was carried out. Dose plans were compared with the conventional two-field tangential photon technique.
RESULTS: PTV coverage was comparable for non-IMRT and IMRT techniques (EUD from 47.1 to 49.4 Gy), and improved with single-field proton treatment (EUD=49.8 Gy). Lung irradiation was reduced, in terms of mean dose, with three-field (9.5 Gy) and proton technique (3.5 Gy), with respect to the conventional two-field treatment (12.9 Gy); also a reduction of the lung volume irradiated at high doses was observed. Better results could be achieved with protons. In addition, cardiac irradiation was also reduced with those techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: Geometrically difficult breast cancer patients could be irradiated with a three-field non-IMRT technique thus reducing the dose to the lung which is proposed as standard for this category of patients. Intensity modulated techniques were only marginally more successful than the corresponding non-IMRT treatments, while protons offer excellent results.},

METHODS AND MATERIAL: For each of 11 patient studies, one proton plan, one IMRT, and two conventional (tangential and patched) plans were calculated using a three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS(). The evaluation of the different treatment plans was made by applying the normal tissue complication probability model (NTCP) proposed by Källman (also denoted the relative seriality model) on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. The organs at risk are the spinal cord, the left lung, the heart, and the non-critical normal tissues (including the right breast).
RESULTS: The comparison demonstrated that the proton treatment plans provide significantly lower NTCP values for the heart and lung when compared to conventional radiation qualities including IMRT for all 11 patients. At a prescribed dose of 50 Gy in the PTV, the calculated mean NTCP value for the patients decreased, on the average, from 14.7 to 0.6\% for the lung (radiation pneumonitis) for the proton plans compared with the best plan using conventional radiation qualities. The corresponding figures for the heart (cardiac mortality) were from 2.1 to 0.5\%. The figures for cardiac mortality for IMRT, tangential technique and the patched technique were 2.2, 6.7, and 2.1\%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have major advantages in terms of lower complication risks when compared with treatments using conventional radiation qualities for treating node-positive left-sided breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery.},

The purpose of this study was to compare the dosimetric differences in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), helical tomotherapy (HT), and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) to find an optimal radiotherapy technique for bilateral breast cancer radiotherapy. Methods: For 11 patients who received synchronous bilateral whole-breast irradiation without local lymph nodal regions, six plans were designed for each patient: IMRT with a single isocenter (IMRT-ISO1), IMRT with two isocenters (IMRT-ISO2), VMAT with a single isocenter (VMAT-ISO1), VMAT with two isocenters (VMAT-ISO2), HT, and IMPT. The differences between the single- and dual-isocentric plans for IMRT and VMAT were compared, and the plan with the better quality was selected for further dosimetric comparisons with IMPT and HT. The plan aimed for a target coverage of at least 95\% with the prescription dose of 50 Gy [relative biological effectiveness (RBE)] while minimizing the dose of organs at risk (OARs). Results: IMRT-ISO1 and VMAT-ISO2 plans were adopted for further dosimetric comparisons because of the reduced dose of the heart and/or lungs compared to IMRT-ISO2 and VMAT-ISO1 plans. The dose coverage of the planning target volume (PTV) was significantly higher in IMPT plans than that in all other plans. VMAT and IMPT plans showed the best conformity, whereas IMRT plans showed the worst conformity. Compared to IMRT and VMAT plans, IMPT and HT plans achieved significantly higher dose homogeneity. IMPT plans reduced the mean dose and low dose volume (V5, V10, and V20) of the heart, left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left ventricle (LV). In high-dose volumes of the heart and cardiac substructures, the IMPT, VMAT, and HT techniques showed similar advantages, and IMRT plans increased the values more than other techniques. IMPT plans had the maximal lung and normal tissue sparing but increased the skin dose compared to IMRT and VMAT plans. Conclusions: IMPT plans improve both the target coverage and the OARs sparing, especially for the heart, cardiac substructures (LAD and LV), lungs and normal tissue, in synchronous bilateral breast radiotherapy. VMAT and HT could be selected as suboptimal techniques for SBBC patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To study the potential reduction of dose to organs at risk (OARs) with intensity-modulated proton radiotherapy (IMPT) compared with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) photon radiotherapy for left-sided breast cancer patients.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Comparative treatment-planning was performed using planning computed tomography scans of 20 left-sided breast cancer patients. For each patient, three increasingly complex locoregional volumes (planning target volumes [PTVs]) were defined: whole breast (WB) or chest wall (CW) = (PTV1), WB/CW plus medial-supraclavicular (MSC), lateral-supraclavicular (LSC), and level III axillary (AxIII) nodes = (PTV2) and WB/CW+MSC+LSC+AxIII plus internal mammary chain = (PTV3). For each patient, 3D-CRT, IMRT, and IMPT plans were optimized for PTV coverage. Dose to OARs was compared while maintaining target coverage.
RESULTS: All the techniques met the required PTV coverage except the 3D-CRT plans for PTV3-scenario. All 3D-CRT plans for PTV3 exceeded left-lung V20. IMPT vs. 3D-CRT: significant dose reductions were observed for all OARs using IMPT for all PTVs. IMPT vs. IMRT: For PTV2 and PTV3, low (V5) left lung and cardiac doses were reduced by a factor {\textgreater}2.5, and cardiac doses (V22.5) were by a factor of {\textgreater}20 lower with IMPT compared with IMRT.
CONCLUSIONS: When complex-target irradiation is needed, 3D-CRT often compromises the target coverage and increases the dose to OARs; IMRT can provide better results but will increase the integral dose. The benefit of IMPT is based on improved target coverage and reduction of low doses to OARs, potentially reducing the risk of late-toxicity. These results indicate a potential role of proton-radiotherapy for extended locoregional irradiation in left breast cancer.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate, using comparative treatment planning, the potential improvements that could result through the use of intensity-modulated photons (intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT]) and protons for the locoregional treatment of complex-target breast cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using CT data from a breast cancer patient, treatment plans were computed using "standard" photon/electron, IMRT, and forward-planned proton techniques. A dose of 50 Gy was prescribed to the target volume consisting of the involved breast, internal mammary, supraclavicular, and axillary nodes. The standard plan was designed using 6-MV X-ray beams to the breast, axillary, and supraclavicular areas and a mixture of 6-MV X-rays and 12-MeV electrons for the internal mammary nodes. Two IMRT (IMX1 and IMX2) plans were calculated for nine evenly spaced beams using dose-volume constraints to the organs at risk. For plan IMX1, precedence was given to optimizing the reduction in lung and heart dose while preserving target dose homogeneity. For plan IMX2, an increased precedence was given to the lungs, heart, and contralateral breast to further reduce doses to these organs and to study the effect on target coverage. The proton plan consisted of two oblique, energy-modulated fields. Target dose homogeneity and the doses to neighboring organs were both considered when comparing the different plans.
RESULTS: For the standard plan, dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the target volumes showed severe dose heterogeneity, whereas target coverage for the IMRT and proton plans was comparable. Lung DVHs for the standard and IMRT plans were also comparable, while the proton plan showed the best sparing over all dose levels. Mean doses to the ipsilateral lung for the three plans were found to be 17 Gy, 15 Gy, and 13 Gy for the standard, IMRT, and proton plans, respectively. For the heart, the IMRT plan delivered the highest mean dose (16 Gy), reflecting the extra dose delivered through this organ to spare the lungs. This was reduced somewhat by the standard plan (15 Gy), with the best sparing being provided by the proton plan (6 Gy). When the IMRT plan was reoptimized with an increased precedence to the normal tissues, the mean doses to all neighboring organs at risk could be reduced, but only at the cost of substantial target dose heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with the standard plan, IMRT photons have the potential to greatly improve the target dose homogeneity with only a small increase in the doses delivered to the neighboring critical structures. However, when attempting to further reduce doses to the critical structures, substantial loss of target dose homogeneity was found. In conclusion, only the two-field, energy-modulated proton plan had the potential to preserve target dose homogeneity while simultaneously minimizing the dose delivered to both lungs, heart, and the contralateral breast.},
