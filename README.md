## üõ† Local Development

You can run the project locally using Docker Compose:

### 1. Start the project

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will build the presentation in the `/quarto/_output/` directory.

### 2. Preview your slides

Open `index.html` inside the `_output` folder in your browser.

### 3. Modify and Rebuild

To customize your slides:

- Edit `index.qmd` and the files inside `/chapters/`
- Then re-run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

- Refresh your browser to see the updates.

## üöÄ Optional: Install Quarto Locally

If you prefer to run Quarto outside Docker, follow the official [installation guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and render slides manually:

```bash
quarto render index.qmd --to revealjs
```

## üîÅ CI/CD with GitLab/GitHub

This project supports automated deployment for both GitLab and GitHub:

- For GitLab, the included .gitlab-ci.yml file builds and deploys your slides to GitLab Pages when changes are pushed to the repository.

- For GitHub, the .github/workflows/deploy.yml workflow handles the build and publishes the slides to GitHub Pages automatically.
